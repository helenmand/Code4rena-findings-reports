# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Tessera smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between December 16â€”December 19 2022.

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens (IllIllI, Lambda, and [gzeon](https://twitter.com/gzeon)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues; the mitigation review report is appended below the audit contest report.

## Wardens

5 Wardens contributed reports to the Tessera - Versus contest:

  1. IllIllI
  2. Lambda
  3. [Trust](https://twitter.com/trust__90)
  4. cccz
  5. [gzeon](https://twitter.com/gzeon)

This contest was judged by [hickuphh3](https://github.com/HickupHH3).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 18 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 9 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 9 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 4 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 2 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Tessera - Versus contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera), and is composed of 5 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 795 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (9)
## [[H-01] GroupBuy does not check return value of call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/6)

### Impact

Both usages of `call` do not check if the transfer of ETH was succesful:

```solidity
payable(msg.sender).call{value: contribution}("");
...
payable(msg.sender).call{value: balance}("");
```

This can become very problematic when the recipient is a smart contract that reverts (for instance, temporarily) in its `receive` function. Then, `GroupBuy` still assumes that this ETH was transferred out and sets the balance to 0 or deletes `userContributions[_poolId][msg.sender]`, although no ETH was transferred. This leads to a loss of funds for the recipient.

### Proof Of Concept

We assume that the recipient is a smart contract that performs some logic in its `receive` function. For instance, it can be a nice feature for some people to automatically convert all incoming ETH into another token using an AMM. However, it can happen that the used AMM has too little liquidity at the moment or the slippage of a swap would be too high, leading to a revert in the receing contract. In such a scenario, the `GroupBuy` contract still thinks that the call was succesful, leading to lost funds for the recipient.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`require` that the call was successful.

## [[H-02] GroupBuy: Lost ETH when the NFT is bought for less than the minimum reserve price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/7)
*Submitted by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/7), also found by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/19)*

The `purchase` function does not require that an NFT is bought for exactly `minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId]`, the price is only not allowed to be greater:

```solidity
if (_price > minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId])
            revert InvalidPurchase();
```

This makes sense because it is not sensible to pay more when the purchase also succeeds with a smaller amount. However, the logic within `claim` does assume that the NFT was bought for `minReservePrices[_poolId]`. It decreases from `contribution` the quantity times the reserve price for all bids:

```solidity
contribution -= quantity * reservePrice;
```

Only the remaining amount is reimbursed to the user, which can lead to a loss of funds.

### Proof Of Concept

Let's say that `filledQuantities[_poolId] = 100` and `minReservePrices[_poolId]` (i.e., the lowest bid) was 1 ETH. However, it was possible to buy the NFT for only 50 ETH. When a user has contributed 20 &ast; 1 ETH, he does not get anything back when calling `claim`, although only 10 ETH (0.5 ETH &ast; 20) of his contributions were used to buy the NFT. The overall loss of funds for all contributors is 50 ETH.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set `minReservePrices[_poolId]` to `_price / filledQuantities[_poolId]` after a purchase.

## [[H-03] Groupbuy:` _verifyUnsuccessfulState` and `_verifySuccessfulState` both can return true when block.timestamp == pool.terminationPeriod](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/10)
*Submitted by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/10)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/1e408ebc1c4fdcc72678ea7f21a94d38855ccc0b/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L455> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/1e408ebc1c4fdcc72678ea7f21a94d38855ccc0b/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L478>

### Impact

The functions `_verifyUnsuccessfulState` and `_verifySuccessfulState` should always have a differing behavior with regards to reversion, i.e. when one does not revert, the other should revert. In one condition, this is not true. Namely, when we have `pool.success == false` and `block.timestamp == pool.terminationPeriod`, this check within `_verifyUnsuccessfulState` is `false`:

```solidity
if (pool.success || block.timestamp > pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState();
```

Similarly, this check within `_verifySuccessfulState` is also `false`:

```solidity
if (!pool.success && block.timestamp < pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState();
```

Because this breaks a fundamental invariant of the contract, there are probably multiple ways to exploit it.
One way an attacker can exploit is by calling `claim` (to get his contribution back completely), bidding again with a higher value than his previous contributions (to get his contributions back again).

### Proof Of Concept

Let's assume we are at timestamp `pool.terminationPeriod`. Attacker Charlie has performed the lowest bid with quantity 10 and price 1 ETH. He calls `claim` to get his 10 ETH back. Now, he calls `contribute` with a quantity of 10 and a price of 2 ETH. Because this bid is higher than his previous one (which was the lowest one), his `pendingBalances` is set to 10 ETH (for the deleted entries) and his `userContributions` is set to 20 ETH (for this new contribution). He can now call `claim` again to get back his 20 ETH in `userContributions`, but also the 10 ETH in `pendingBalances`. Like that, he has stolen 10 ETH (and could use this attack pattern to drain the whole contract).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `<` in `_verifySuccessfulState` to `<=`.

**[HickupHH3 (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-1358723568):**
 > Given that block timestamp period for ETH mainnet is now a constant 12s, the probability of a block timestamp being equal to `terminationPeriod` is 1/12 (~8.3%), which is non-trivial.

## [[H-04] OptimisticListingSeaport.propose sets pendingBalances of newly added proposer instead of previous one](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/12)
*Submitted by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/12), also found by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/53)*

In `OptimisticListingSeaport.propose`, `pendingBalances` is set to the collateral. The purpose of this is that the proposer of a previous proposal can withdraw his collateral afterwards. However, this is done on the storage variable `proposedListing` after the new listing is already set:

```solidity
_setListing(proposedListing, msg.sender, _collateral, _pricePerToken, block.timestamp);

// Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal
pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral;
```

Because of that, it will actually set `pendingBalances` of the new proposer. Therefore, the old proposer loses his collateral and the new one can make proposals for free.

### Proof Of Concept

```diff
--- a/test/seaport/OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol
+++ b/test/seaport/OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol
@@ -379,8 +379,11 @@ contract OptimisticListingSeaportTest is SeaportTestUtil {

         _collateral = _boundCollateral(_collateral, bobTokenBalance);
         _price = _boundPrice(_price);
```

This test fails and `optimistic.pendingBalances(vault, bob)` is equal to `_collateral`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Run `pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral;` before the `_setListing` call, in which case the above PoC no longer works.

## [[H-05] Attacker can DOS OptimisticListing with very low cost](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/25)
*Submitted by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/25), also found by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/42), [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/41), and [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/15)*

The only check on a new proposal is that it is priced lower than the existing proposal. It does not constrain on the `_collateral` supplied (except it will revert in `\_verifyBalance` if set to 0). Anyone can block normal proposal creation by creating a proposal with lower price but `\_collateral == 1`. When a high total supply is used, the price of each Rae is negligible and enables an attacker to DOS the protocol.

This violated the `prevent a user from holding a vault hostage and never letting the piece be reasonably bought` requirement.

### Proof of Concept

For any proposal, an attacker can deny it with `\_collateral = 1` and `\_price = price - 1`.

If he does not want the NFT to be sold, he can reject the proposal himself, resetting the contract state.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol#L112-L116>

```solidity
        // Reverts if price per token is not lower than both the proposed and active listings
        if (
            _pricePerToken >= proposedListing.pricePerToken ||
            _pricePerToken >= activeListings[_vault].pricePerToken
        ) revert NotLower();
```

Add this test to OptimisticListingSeaport.t.sol:

        function testProposeRevertLowerTotalValue() public {
            uint256 _collateral = 100;
            uint256 _price = 100;
            // setup
            testPropose(_collateral, _price);
            lowerPrice = pricePerToken - 1;
            // execute
            vm.expectRevert();
            _propose(eve, vault, 1, lowerPrice, offer);
            // expect
            _assertListing(eve, 1, lowerPrice, block.timestamp);
            _assertTokenBalance(eve, token, tokenId, eveTokenBalance - 1);
        }

\[FAIL. Reason: Call did not revert as expected]

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Require the total value of the new collateral to be greater than the previous.

This however still allows a Rae holder with sufficiently large holding to block proposal by creating a new proposal and immediately reject it himself.

## [[H-06] Funds are permanently stuck in OptimisticListingSeaport.sol contract if active proposal is executed after new proposal is pending.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/43)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/43)*

`\_constructOrder` is called in `propose()`, OptimisticListingSeaport.sol. It fills the order params stored in proposedListings\[\_vault].

    {
        orderParams.offerer = _vault;
        orderParams.startTime = block.timestamp;
        // order doesn't expire in human time scales and needs explicit cancellations
        orderParams.endTime = type(uint256).max;
        orderParams.zone = zone;
        // 0: no partial fills, anyone can execute
        orderParams.orderType = OrderType.FULL_OPEN;
        orderParams.conduitKey = conduitKey;
        // 1 Consideration for the listing itself + 1 consideration for the fees
        orderParams.totalOriginalConsiderationItems = 3;
    }

Importantly, it updates the order hash associated with the vault:
`vaultOrderHash[_vault] = _getOrderHash(orderParams, counter);`

There is only one other use of `vaultOrderHash`, in `\_verifySale()`.

    function _verifySale(address _vault) internal view returns (bool status) {
        (bool isValidated, bool isCancelled, uint256 totalFilled, uint256 totalSize) = ISeaport(
            seaport
        ).getOrderStatus(vaultOrderHash[_vault]);
        if (isValidated && !isCancelled && totalFilled > 0 && totalFilled == totalSize) {
            status = true;
        }
    }

This function gets order information from the order hash, and makes sure the order is completely fulfilled.

After NFT sell has completed, `cash()` is used to distribute income ETH:

    function cash(address _vault, bytes32[] calldata _burnProof) external {
        // Reverts if vault is not registered
        (address token, uint256 id) = _verifyVault(_vault);
        // Reverts if active listing has not been settled
        Listing storage activeListing = activeListings[_vault];
        // Reverts if listing has not been sold
    	  // -------------- _verifySale MUST BE TRUE ---------
        if (!_verifySale(_vault)) {
            revert NotSold();
        } else if (activeListing.collateral != 0) {
            uint256 collateral = activeListing.collateral;
            activeListing.collateral = 0;
            // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal
            pendingBalances[_vault][activeListing.proposer] = collateral;
        }

As long as sale is not complete, `cash()` can't be called as highlighted. The issue is that `vaultOrderHash[_vault]` is not protected during the lifetime of an active proposal. If another proposal is proposed and then the sell using active proposal takes place, `cash()` will keep reverting. Funds are stuck in listing contract.

We can try to be clever and call `propose()` again with the same parameters to create an identical orderID, which will make `vaultOrderHash[_vault]` fine again and allow `cash()` to go through. But order params contain block.timestamp which will certainly be different which will make the hash different.

### Impact

Funds are permanently stuck in OptimisticListingSeaport.sol contract if active proposal is executed after new proposal is pending.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User A calls `propose()`, setting proposedListing. vaultOrderHash=X
2.  PROPOSAL_PERIOD passes , list is called promoting the listing to activeListing.
3.  Another user, malicious or innocent, proposes another proposal. vaultOrderHash=Y
4.  Sell goes down due to OpenSea validation confirmed on activeListing.
5.  `\_verifySale` will never return true because we can never got vaultOrderHash to be X
6.  cash() is bricked. Money is stuck in contract.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Keep the order hash in the Listing structure rather than a single one per vault.

### Description

In OptimisticListingOpensea, there are several functions which update pendingBalances of a proposer:

1.  `list()`
2.  `cash()`
3.  `propose()`

Unfortunately, in `list()` and `cash()` the = operator is used instead of += when writing the new pendingBalances. For example:

    function cash(address _vault, bytes32[] calldata _burnProof) external {
        // Reverts if vault is not registered
        (address token, uint256 id) = _verifyVault(_vault);
        // Reverts if active listing has not been settled
        Listing storage activeListing = activeListings[_vault];
        // Reverts if listing has not been sold
        if (!_verifySale(_vault)) {
            revert NotSold();
        } else if (activeListing.collateral != 0) {
            uint256 collateral = activeListing.collateral;
            activeListing.collateral = 0;
            // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal
            pendingBalances[_vault][activeListing.proposer] = collateral;
        }
    	...

pendingBalances is not guaranteed to be zero. There could be funds from previous proposals which are not yet collected. Propose updates pendingBalance correctly:

    // Sets collateral amount to pending balances for withdrawal
    pendingBalances[_vault][proposedListing.proposer] += proposedListing.collateral;

So, when propose is followed by another propose(), the pendingBalance is updated correctly, but in cash and list we don't account for pre-existing balance. This issue would manifest even after the fix suggested in the issue "User can send a proposal and instantly take back their collateral" because reject functions would increment the pendingBalance and then it would be overriden.

### Impact

User loses collateral converted to pendingBalance when `cash()` or `list()` is called.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User calls `propose()` and gets pendingBalance = x
2.  User calls `propose()` with an improved proposal and gets pendingBalance = 1.5x
3.  proposal is successfull and the listing purchased the NFT
4.  `cash()` is called to convert the Raes to ETH amount from the sell. pendingBalance is overridden by the current "collateral"  value. pendingBalance = 0.5x
5.  User loses x collateral value which is stuck in the contract

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the = operator to += in `list()` and `cash()`.

## [[H-08] Attacker can steal the amount collected so far in the GroupBuy for NFT purchase.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/47)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/47), also found by [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/39) and [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/9)*

`purchase()` in GroupBuy.sol executes the purchase call for the group. After safety checks, the NFT is bought with `\_market`'s `execute()` function. Supposedly it deploys a vault which owns the NFT. The code makes sure the vault is the new owner of the NFT and exits.

    // Executes purchase order transaction through market buyer contract and deploys new vault
    address vault = IMarketBuyer(_market).execute{value: _price}(_purchaseOrder);
    // Checks if NFT contract supports ERC165 and interface ID of ERC721 tokens
    if (ERC165Checker.supportsInterface(_nftContract, _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721)) {
        // Verifes vault is owner of ERC-721 token
        if (IERC721(_nftContract).ownerOf(_tokenId) != vault) revert UnsuccessfulPurchase();
    } else {
        // Verifies vault is owner of CryptoPunk token
        if (ICryptoPunk(_nftContract).punkIndexToAddress(_tokenId) != vault)
            revert UnsuccessfulPurchase();
    }

    // Stores mapping value of poolId to newly deployed vault
    poolToVault[_poolId] = vault;
    // Sets pool state to successful
    poolInfo[_poolId].success = true;
    // Emits event for purchasing NFT at given price
    emit Purchase(_poolId, vault, _nftContract, _tokenId, _price);

The issue is that `\_market` user-supplied variable is not validated at all. Attacker can pass their malicious contract, which uses the passed funds to buy the NFT and store it in attacker's wallet. It will return the NFT-holding wallet so the checks will pass. As a result, attacker has the NFT while they could have contributed nothing to the GroupBuy. Attacker can also just steal the supplied ETH and return the current address which holds the NFT.

### Impact

Attacker can steal the amount collected so far in the GroupBuy for NFT purchase.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Group assembles and raises funds to buy NFT X
2.  Attacker calls `purchase()` and supplies their malicious contract in `\_market`, as described.
3.  Attacker receives raised funds totalling  `minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId]`, as checked in line 182.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`\_market` should be whitelisted, or supplied in createPool stage and able to be scrutinized.

## [[H-09] GroupBuy can be drained of all ETH.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/52)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/52), also found by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/8)*

`purchase()` in GroupBuy faciilitates the purchasing of an NFT after enough contributions were gathered. Another report titled *"Attacker can steal the amount collected so far in the GroupBuy for NFT purchase*" describes a high impact bug in purchase. It is advised to read that first for context.

Additionally, `purchase()` is vulnerable to a re-entrancy exploit which can be *chained* or *not chained* to the `\_market` issue to steal *the entire* ETH stored in GroupBuy, rather than being capped to `minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId]`.

Attacker may take control of execution using this call:

    // Executes purchase order transaction through market buyer contract and deploys new vault
    address vault = IMarketBuyer(_market).execute{value: _price}(_purchaseOrder);

It could occur either by exploiting the unvalidated `\_market` vulnerability , or by abusing an existing market that uses a user address in `\_purchaseOrder`.

There is no re-entrancy protection in `purchase()` call:

    function purchase(
        uint256 _poolId,
        address _market,
        address _nftContract,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _price,
        bytes memory _purchaseOrder,
        bytes32[] memory _purchaseProof
    ) external {

`\_verifyUnsuccessfulState()` needs to not revert for purchase call. It checks the pool.success flag:
`if (pool.success || block.timestamp > pool.terminationPeriod) revert InvalidState();`

However, success is only set as the last thing in `purchase()`:

        // Stores mapping value of poolId to newly deployed vault
        poolToVault[_poolId] = vault;
        // Sets pool state to successful
        poolInfo[_poolId].success = true;
        // Emits event for purchasing NFT at given price
        emit Purchase(_poolId, vault, _nftContract, _tokenId, _price);
    }

Therefore, attacker can re-enter purchase() function multiple times, each time extracting the maximum allowed price. If attacker uses the controlled `\_market` exploit, the function will return the current NFT owner, so when all the functions unwind they will keep setting success to true and exit nicely.

### Impact

GroupBuy can be drained of all ETH.

### Proof of Concept

1.  GroupBuy holds 1500 ETH, from various bids
2.  maximum allowed price (`minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId]`) is 50 &ast; 20 = 1000 ETH
3.  purchase(1000 ETH) is called
    1.  GroupBuy sends attacker 1000 ETH and calls `execute()`
        1.  `execute()` calls purchase(500ETH)
            1.  GroupBuy sends attacker 500 ETH and calls `execute()`
                1.  execute returns NFT owner address
            2.  GroupBuy sees returned address is NFT owner. Marks success and returns
        2.  execute returns NFT owner address
    2.  GroupBuy sees returned address is NFT owner. Marks success and returns
4.  Attacker is left with 1500 ETH. Previous exploit alone can only net 1000ETH. Additionally, this exploit can be chained to any trusted MarketBuyer which passes control to user for purchasing and storing in vault, and then returns a valid vault.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a re-entrancy guard to `purchase()` function. Also, change success variable before performing external contract calls.

Since the NFT contract is set when the pool is created, it should not matter whether the contract is malicious or is for an existing market that uses a user address, the pool will just be disregarded.

# Medium Risk Findings (9)
## [[M-01] GroupBuy may purchase NFT not in the allowed list](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/14)
*Submitted by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/14), also found by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/46) and [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/11)*

When `_purchaseProof.length == 0`, GroupBuy.purchase compare the tokenId with the merkleRoot. This allows any tokenId that matches the merkleRoot to be purchased, even if they are not included in the allow list during setup.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L186-L188>

```solidity
        if (_purchaseProof.length == 0) {
            // Hashes tokenId to verify merkle root if proof is empty
            if (bytes32(_tokenId) != merkleRoot) revert InvalidProof();
```

### Proof of Concept

Add the following to GroupBuy.t.sol. It would still revert (since no such nft existed) but not as expected.

        // modified from testPurchaseRevertInvalidProof
        function testPurchaseRevertInvalidTokenIdZeroLength() public {
            // setup
            testContributeSuccess();
            // exploit
            uint256 invalidPunkId = uint256(nftMerkleRoot);
            bytes32[] memory invalidPurchaseProof = new bytes32[](0);
            // expect
            vm.expectRevert(INVALID_PROOF_ERROR);
            // execute
            _purchase(
                address(this),
                currentId,
                address(punksBuyer),
                address(punks),
                invalidPunkId,
                minValue,
                purchaseOrder,
                invalidPurchaseProof
            );
        }

### Tools Used

Foundry

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Hash the tokenId even if there is only when length is 1.

## [[M-02] Attacker can delay proposal rejection](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/24)
*Submitted by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/24)*

In `OptimisticListingSeaport.rejectProposal`, it reverts if `proposedListing.collateral < _amount`. An attacker can therefore monitor the mempool, reducing the `proposedListing.collateral` to `_amount - 1` by frontrunning the `rejectProposal` call and delaying the rejection. The attacker may even be able to deny the rejection when the deadline passes.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol#L145>

```solidity
        if (proposedListing.collateral < _amount) revert InsufficientCollateral();
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol#L153>

```solidity
        proposedListing.collateral -= _amount;
```

### Proof of Concept

1.  Attacker proposes a 10000 collateral at a very low price
2.  Bob tries to reject it by purchasing the 10000 collateral
3.  Attacker sees Bob's tx in the mempool, frontruns it to reject 1 unit
4.  The proposedListing.collateral is now 9999
5.  Bob's call reverted
6.  This keeps happening until PROPOSAL_PERIOD passes or Bob gave up because of gas paid on failing tx
7.  Attacker buys the NFT at a very low price

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When `proposedListing.collateral < _amount`, set `\_amount` to proposedListing.collateral and refund the excess.

 > While annoying, I think this is a Medium severity issue.  The attacker has to under price their proposal, defend this under priced proposal from other users and front run each purchase > 1, while selling their Raes at a loss, and it would be relatively costly for griefer to defend their underpriced proposal for the duration of the proposal period.  Users could purchase 1 Rae at a time without risk of front running.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L114-L150>

### Vulnerability details

If a user contributes funds after there is no more supply left, and they don't provide a price higher than the current minimum bid, they will be unable to withdraw their funds while the NFT remains unbought.

### Impact

Ether becomes stuck until and unless the NFT is bought, which may never happen.

### Proof of Concept

When making a contribution, the user calls the `payable` `contribute()` function. If the supply has already been filled (`fillAtAnyPriceQuantity` is zero), the bid isn't inserted into the queue, so the new bid is not tracked anywhere. When the function reaches `processBidsInQueue()`...:

```solidity
// File: src/modules/GroupBuy.sol : GroupBuy.contribute()   #1

99         function contribute(
100            uint256 _poolId,
101            uint256 _quantity,
102            uint256 _price
103 @>     ) public payable {
104            // Reverts if pool ID is not valid
105            _verifyPool(_poolId);
106            // Reverts if NFT has already been purchased OR termination period has passed
107            (, uint48 totalSupply, , , ) = _verifyUnsuccessfulState(_poolId);
108            // Reverts if ether contribution amount per Rae is less than minimum bid price per Rae
109            if (msg.value < _quantity * minBidPrices[_poolId] || _quantity == 0)
110                revert InvalidContribution();
111            // Reverts if ether payment amount is not equal to total amount being contributed

127                // Increments total amount of filled quantities
128                filledQuantities[_poolId] += fillAtAnyPriceQuantity;
129            }
130    
131            // Calculates unfilled quantity amount based on desired quantity and actual filled quantity amount
132            uint256 unfilledQuantity = _quantity - fillAtAnyPriceQuantity;

...until the order has gone through, and they can `claim()` excess funds, but there likely won't be any, due to the separate MEV bug I raised:

```solidity

229            // Reverts if pool ID is not valid
230            _verifyPool(_poolId);
231            // Reverts if purchase has not been made AND termination period has not passed
232            (, , , bool success, ) = _verifySuccessfulState(_poolId);
233            // Reverts if contribution balance of user is insufficient
234 @>         uint256 contribution = userContributions[_poolId][msg.sender];
235            if (contribution == 0) revert InsufficientBalance();
236

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`revert()` if the price is lower than the min bid, and the queue is already full

## [[M-04] Priority queue min accounting breaks when nodes are split in two](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/32)
*Submitted by [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/32), also found by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/51)*

The README states `If two users place bids at the same price but with different quantities, the queue will pull from the bid with a higher quantity first`, but the data-structure used for implementing this logic, is not used properly and essentially has its data corrupted when a large bid that is the current minimum bid, is split into two parts, so that a more favorable price can be used for a fraction of the large bid. The underlying issue is that one of the tree nodes is modified, without re-shuffling that node's location in the tree.

### Impact

The minimum bid as told by the priority queue will be wrong, leading to the wrong bids being allowed to withdraw their funds, and being kicked out of the fraction of bids that are used to buy the NFT.

### Proof of Concept

The priority queue using a binary tree within an array to [efficiently navigate and find the current minimum based on a node and its children](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/). The sorting of the nodes in the tree is based, in part, on the quantity in the case where two bids have the same price:

```solidity
// File: src/lib/MinPriorityQueue.sol : MinPriorityQueue.isGreater()   #1

111        function isGreater(
112            Queue storage self,
113            uint256 i,
114            uint256 j
115        ) private view returns (bool) {
116            Bid memory bidI = self.bidIdToBidMap[self.bidIdList[i]];
117            Bid memory bidJ = self.bidIdToBidMap[self.bidIdList[j]];
118 @>         if (bidI.price == bidJ.price) {
119 @>             return bidI.quantity <= bidJ.quantity;
120            }
121            return bidI.price > bidJ.price;
122:       }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/lib/MinPriorityQueue.sol#L111-L122>

The algorithm of the binary tree only works when the nodes are properly sorted. The sorting is corrupted when a node is modified, without removing it from the tree and re-inserting it:

```solidity
// File: src/modules/GroupBuy.sol : GroupBuy.processBidsInQueue()   #2

299                Bid storage lowestBid = bidPriorityQueues[_poolId].getMin();
300                // Breaks out of while loop if given price is less than than lowest bid price
301                if (_price < lowestBid.price) {
302                    break;
303                }
304    
305                uint256 lowestBidQuantity = lowestBid.quantity;
306                // Checks if lowest bid quantity amount is greater than given quantity amount
307                if (lowestBidQuantity > quantity) {
308                    // Decrements given quantity amount from lowest bid quantity
309 @>                 lowestBid.quantity -= quantity;
310                    // Calculates partial contribution of bid by quantity amount and price
311                    uint256 contribution = quantity * lowestBid.price;
312    
313                    // Decrements partial contribution amount of lowest bid from total and user contributions
314                    totalContributions[_poolId] -= contribution;
315                    userContributions[_poolId][lowestBid.owner] -= contribution;
316                    // Increments pending balance of lowest bid owner
317                    pendingBalances[lowestBid.owner] += contribution;
318    
319:                   // Inserts new bid with given quantity amount into proper position of queue
```
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L299-L319>

Let's say that the tree looks like this:

```
            A:(p:100,q:10)
            /             \
       B:(p:100,q:10)  C:(<whatever>)
       /           \
D:(whatever)   E:(whatever) 

```

If A is modified so that q (quantity) goes from 10 to 5, B should now be at the root of the tree, since it has the larger size, and would be considered the smaller node. When another node is added, say, `F:(p:100,q:6)`, the algorithm will see that F has a larger size than A, and so A will be popped out as the min, even though B should have been. All nodes that are under B (which may be a lot of the nodes if they all entered at the same price/quantity) essentially become invisible under various scenarios, which means the users that own those bids will not be able to withdraw their funds, even if they really are the lowest bid that deserves to be pushed out of the queue. Note that the swimming up that is done for `F` will not re-shuffle `B` since, according to the algorithm, `F` will start as a child of `C`, and `B` is not in the list of parent nodes of `C`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When modifying nodes of the tree, remove them first, then re-add them after modification.

## [[M-05] Orders may not be fillable due to missing approvals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/36)
*Submitted by [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/36), also found by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/56)*

Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. If one of these tokens returns false, there is no check for whether this has happened during the order listing validation, so it will only be detected when the order is attempted.

### Impact

If the approval failure isn't detected, the listing will never be fillable, because the funds won't be able to be pulled from the opensea conduit. Once this happens, and if it's detected, the only way to fix it is to create a counter-listing at a lower price (which may be below the market value of the tokens), waiting for the order to expire (which it may never), or by buying out all of the Rae to cancel the order (very expensive and defeats the purpose of pooling funds in the first place).

### Proof of Concept

The return value of `approve()` isn't checked, so the order will be allowed to be listed without having approved the conduit:

```solidity
// File: src/seaport/targets/SeaportLister.sol : SeaportLister.validateListing()   #1

29                for (uint256 i; i < ordersLength; ++i) {
30                    uint256 offerLength = _orders[i].parameters.offer.length;
31                    for (uint256 j; j < offerLength; ++j) {
32                        OfferItem memory offer = _orders[i].parameters.offer[j];
33                        address token = offer.token;
34                        ItemType itemType = offer.itemType;
35                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC721)
36                            IERC721(token).setApprovalForAll(conduit, true);
37                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC1155)
38                            IERC1155(token).setApprovalForAll(conduit, true);
39                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC20)
40 @>                         IERC20(token).approve(conduit, type(uint256).max);
41                    }
42                }
43            }
44            // Validates the order on-chain so no signature is required to fill it
45            assert(ConsiderationInterface(_consideration).validate(_orders));
46:       }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()`, which checks the return code and reverts if it's not success.

## [[M-06] Only one `GroupBuy` can ever use USDT or similar tokens with front-running approval protections](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/37)
*Submitted by [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/37)*

Calling `approve()` without first calling `approve(0)` if the current approval is non-zero will revert with some tokens, such as Tether (USDT). While Tether is known to do this, it applies to other tokens as well, which are trying to protect against [this attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit).

### Impact

Only the first listing will start with the conduit's approval at zero and will be able to change it to the maximum. Thereafter, every attempt to approve that same token will revert, causing any order using this lister to revert, including a re-listing at a lower price, which the protocol allows for.

### Proof of Concept

The seaport conduit address is set in the constructor as an immutable variable, so it's not possible to change it once the issue is hit:

```solidity
// File: src/seaport/targets/SeaportLister.sol : SeaportLister.constructor()   #1

19        constructor(address _conduit) {
20 @>         conduit = _conduit;
21:       }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/targets/SeaportLister.sol#L19-L21>

The approval is set to the maximum without checking whether it's already the maximum:

```solidity
// File: src/seaport/targets/SeaportLister.sol : SeaportLister.validateListing()   #2

29                for (uint256 i; i < ordersLength; ++i) {
30                    uint256 offerLength = _orders[i].parameters.offer.length;
31                    for (uint256 j; j < offerLength; ++j) {
32                        OfferItem memory offer = _orders[i].parameters.offer[j];
33                        address token = offer.token;
34                        ItemType itemType = offer.itemType;
35                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC721)
36                            IERC721(token).setApprovalForAll(conduit, true);
37                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC1155)
38                            IERC1155(token).setApprovalForAll(conduit, true);
39                        if (itemType == ItemType.ERC20)
40 @>                         IERC20(token).approve(conduit, type(uint256).max);
41                    }
42                }
43            }
44            // Validates the order on-chain so no signature is required to fill it
45            assert(ConsiderationInterface(_consideration).validate(_orders));
46:       }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/seaport/targets/SeaportLister.sol#L29-L46>

The README states: `The Tessera Protocol is designed around the concept of Hyperstructures, which are crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries`, and having to deploy a new `SeaportLister` in order to have a fresh conduit that also needs to be deployed, is not `without maintenance or interruption`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Always reset the approval to zero before changing it to the maximum.

The Vault delegate calls to the Seaport Lister so these approvals would be scoped to the Vault so multiple listing are possible through the target contract.  But a vault that relists wouldn't be able to relist an ERC20 with front running protection.

## [[M-07] Loss of ETH for proposer when it is a contract that doesn't have fallback function.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/40)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/40)*

`sendEthOrWeth()` is used in several locations in OptimisticListingSeaport:

1.  rejectProposal - sent to proposer
2.  rejectActive - sent to proposer
3.  cash - sent to msg.sender

This is the implementation of sendEthOrWeth:

    function _attemptETHTransfer(address _to, uint256 _value) internal returns (bool success) {
        // Here increase the gas limit a reasonable amount above the default, and try
        // to send ETH to the recipient.
        // NOTE: This might allow the recipient to attempt a limited reentrancy attack.
        (success, ) = _to.call{value: _value, gas: 30000}("");
    }
    /// @notice Sends eth or weth to an address
    /// @param _to Address to send to
    /// @param _value Amount to send
    function _sendEthOrWeth(address _to, uint256 _value) internal {
        if (!_attemptETHTransfer(_to, _value)) {
            WETH(WETH_ADDRESS).deposit{value: _value}();
            WETH(WETH_ADDRESS).transfer(_to, _value);
        }
    }

The issue is that the receive could be a contract that does not have a fallback function. In this scenario, \_attemptETHTransfer will fail and WETH would be transferred to the contract. It is likely that it bricks those funds for the contract as there is no reason it would support interaction with WETH tokens.

It can be reasonably assumed that developers will develop contracts which will interact with OptimisticListingSeaport using proposals. They are not warned and are likely to suffer losses.

### Impact

Loss of ETH for proposer when it is a contract that doesn't have fallback function.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either enforce that proposer is an EOA or take in a recipient address for ETH transfers.

## [[M-08]  Earlier bidders get cut out of future NFT holdings by bidders specifying the same price.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/45)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/45), also found by [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/54)*

In GroupBuy module, users can call contribute to get a piece of the NFT pie. There are two stages in transforming the msg.value to holdings in the NFT.Â 

1.  filling at any price(supply is not yet saturated)

<!---->

    uint256 fillAtAnyPriceQuantity = remainingSupply < _quantity ? remainingSupply : _quantity;
    // Checks if quantity amount being filled is greater than 0
    if (fillAtAnyPriceQuantity > 0) {
        // Inserts bid into end of queue
        bidPriorityQueues[_poolId].insert(msg.sender, _price, fillAtAnyPriceQuantity);
        // Increments total amount of filled quantities
        filledQuantities[_poolId] += fillAtAnyPriceQuantity;
    }

2.  Trim out lower price offers to make room for current higher offer.

<!---->

    // Calculates unfilled quantity amount based on desired quantity and actual filled quantity amount
    uint256 unfilledQuantity = _quantity - fillAtAnyPriceQuantity;
    // Processes bids in queue to recalculate unfilled quantity amount
    unfilledQuantity = processBidsInQueue(_poolId, unfilledQuantity, _price);

The while loop in `processBidsInQueue` will keep removing existing bids with lower price and create new queue entries for currently processed bid. When it reached a bid with a higher price than msg.sender's price, it will break:

    while (quantity > 0) {
        // Retrieves lowest bid in queue
        Bid storage lowestBid = bidPriorityQueues[_poolId].getMin();
        // Breaks out of while loop if given price is less than than lowest bid price
        if (_price < lowestBid.price) {
            break;
        }

The issue is that when `_price  == lowestBid.price`, we don't break and current bid will kick out older bid, as can be seen here:

    // Decrements given quantity amount from lowest bid quantity
    lowestBid.quantity -= quantity;
    // Calculates partial contribution of bid by quantity amount and price
    uint256 contribution = quantity * lowestBid.price;
    // Decrements partial contribution amount of lowest bid from total and user contributions
    totalContributions[_poolId] -= contribution;
    userContributions[_poolId][lowestBid.owner] -= contribution;
    // Increments pending balance of lowest bid owner
    pendingBalances[lowestBid.owner] += contribution;
    // Inserts new bid with given quantity amount into proper position of queue
    bidPriorityQueues[_poolId].insert(msg.sender, _price, quantity);

The described behavior goes against what the docs [describe](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera#step-3-other-users-deposit-funds-to-pool-filtering) will happen when two equal priced bids collide.

### Impact

Earlier bidders get cut out of future NFT holdings by bidders specifying the same price.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the < to <= in the if condition:

    if (_price <= lowestBid.price) {
        break;
    }

 > @HickupHH3 @Trust the final code block in this submission comes from [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L308-L320), which falls under the case where the price is the same and the quantity is different. The readme states `If two users place bids at the same price but with different quantities, the queue will pull from the bid with a higher quantity first`, and as the submission shows, it's pulling from the higher quantity first - doesn't that mean this finding is invalid?

## [[M-09] GroupBuys that are completely filled still don't raise stated target amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/49)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/49), also found by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/57)*

`createPool()` in GroupBuy.sol creates a new contribution pool around an NFT. It specifies a target `\_initialPrice` as minimum amount of ETH the NFT will cost, and `\_totalSupply` which is the number of Raes to be minted on purchase success.

minBidPrices is calculated from the two numbers. All future bids must be at least minBidPrices. It is assumed that if the totalSupply of Raes is filled up, the group will collect the initialPrice.

    // Calculates minimum bid price based on initial price of NFT and desired total supply
    minBidPrices[currentId] = _initialPrice / _totalSupply;

The issue is that division rounding error will make minBidPrices too low. Therefore, when all Raes are minted using minBidPrices price:
`minBidPrices[currentId] * _totalSupply != _initialPrice`

Therefore, not enough money has been collected to fund the purchase.

It can be assumed that most people will use minBidPrices to drive the price they will choose. Therefore, even after discovering that the Group has not raised enough after filling the supply pool, it will be very hard to get everyone to top up the contribution by a bit. This is because the settled price which is collected from all contributions is minReservePrices, which is always the minimum price deposited.

Code in contribute that updates minReservePrices:

    // Updates minimum reserve price if filled quantity amount is greater than 0
    if (filledQuantity > 0) minReservePrices[_poolId] = getMinPrice(_poolId);

The check in purchase() that we don't charge more than minReservePrices from each contribution:

    if (_price > minReservePrices[_poolId] * filledQuantities[_poolId])
        revert InvalidPurchase();

We can see an important contract functionality is not working as expected which will impair NFT purchases.

### Impact

GroupBuys that are completely filled still don't raise stated target amount.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Round the minBidPrices up, rather than down. It will ensure enough funds are collected.

## [L&#x2011;01]  Bid size is an unfair ordering metric
The README states that this is intentional, so I've filed it as Low rather than Medium, but giving priority to bids with the smaller quantity is not a fair ordering mechanic. A person with a lot of funds may have gotten that by pooling externally to the contract, and it's not fair to kick them out of the pool earlier than another address that came in later.

## [L&#x2011;02]  Users may DOS themselves with a lot of smalle payments
If a user has to contribute to a pool via lots of dust payments (e.g. if they only have enough money each week to spend a few wei), they may eventually add enough payments that when it's time to claim their excess, their for-loop below exceeds the block gas limit.

248              for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
249                  // Gets bid quantity from storage
250:                 Bid storage bid = bidPriorityQueues[_poolId].bidIdToBidMap[bidIds[i]];

## [L&#x2011;03]  Empty `receive()`/`payable fallback()` function does not authorize requests
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. `require(msg.sender == address(weth))`). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds. If the concern is having to spend a small amount of gas to check the sender against an immutable address, the code should at least have a function to rescue unused Ether.

## [L&#x2011;04]  `require()` should be used instead of `assert()`
Prior to solidity version 0.8.0, hitting an assert consumes the **remainder of the transaction's available gas** rather than returning it, as `require()`/`revert()` do. `assert()` should be avoided even past solidity version 0.8.0 as its [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require) states that "The assert function creates an error of type Panic(uint256). ... Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix".

## [N&#x2011;07]  Consider using `delete` rather than assigning zero to clear values
The `delete` keyword more closely matches the semantics of what is being done, and draws more attention to the changing of state, which may lead to a more thorough audit of its associated logic.

*There are 4 instances of this issue:*

```solidity

437:          orderParams.totalOriginalConsiderationItems = 0;

## [N&#x2011;08]  Contracts should have full test coverage
While 100% code coverage does not guarantee that there are no bugs, it often will catch easy-to-find bugs, and will ensure that there are fewer regressions when the code invariably has to be modified. Furthermore, in order to get full coverage, code authors will often have to re-organize their code so that it is more modular, so that each component can be tested separately, which reduces interdependencies between modules and layers, and makes for code that is easier to reason about and audit.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: src/lib/MinPriorityQueue.sol


```

## [N&#x2011;09]  Large or complicated code bases should implement fuzzing tests
Large code bases, or code with lots of inline-assembly, complicated math, or complicated interactions between multiple contracts, should implement [fuzzing tests](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-fuzzing-d9b88e0b0a05). Fuzzers such as Echidna require the test writer to come up with invariants which should not be violated under any circumstances, and the fuzzer tests various inputs and function calls to ensure that the invariants always hold. Even code with 100% code coverage can still have bugs due to the order of the operations a user performs, and fuzzers, with properly and extensively-written invariants, can close this testing gap significantly.

# Gas Optimizations

For this contest, 2 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/21) by **gzeon** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/28).*

## Gas Optimizations Summary

*Disclaimer: report extended from 4naly3er tool*

| |Issue|Instances|
|-|:-|:-:|
| [G-01] | Use assembly to check for `address(0)` | 2 |
| [G-02] | Cache array length outside of loop | 2 |
| [G-03] | State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage | 5 |
| [G-04] | Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated | 5 |
| [G-05] | Use Custom Errors | 2 |
| [G-06] | Don't initialize variables with default value | 2 |
| [G-07] | `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too) | 4 |
| [G-08] | Use shift Right/Left instead of division/multiplication if possible | 5 |
| [G-09] | Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison | 5 |

## [G-01] Use assembly to check for `address(0)`
*Saves 6 gas per instance*

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol

106:             proposedListings[_vault].proposer == address(0) &&

107:             activeListings[_vault].proposer == address(0)

```

## [G-02] Cache array length outside of loop
If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: src/lib/MinPriorityQueue.sol

98:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < curUserBids.length; i++) {

```

```solidity

## [G-03] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

*Saves 100 gas per instance*

## [G-04] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated
Mark data types as `calldata` instead of `memory` where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as `calldata`. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies `memory` storage.

## [G-05] Use Custom Errors
[Source](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)

Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.

```solidity

## [G-09] Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison

*Instances (5)*:
```solidity
File: src/modules/GroupBuy.sol

124:         if (fillAtAnyPriceQuantity > 0) {

139:         if (filledQuantity > 0) minReservePrices[_poolId] = getMinPrice(_poolId);

268:         if (pendingBalances[msg.sender] > 0) withdrawBalance();

```solidity
File: src/seaport/modules/OptimisticListingSeaport.sol

469:         if (isValidated && !isCancelled && totalFilled > 0 && totalFilled == totalSize) {

```

## [G-10] Use unchecked when it is safe

For example, those dealing with eth value will basically never overflow:

```solidity
        userContributions[_poolId][msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalContributions[_poolId] += msg.value;
```
[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L115-L116)

```solidity
            filledQuantities[_poolId] += fillAtAnyPriceQuantity;
```
[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L128)

Also those with explicit check before

```solidity
                lowestBid.quantity -= quantity;
```
[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L309)

## [G-11] Refund contribution and pending balance in the same call

```solidity
        // Transfers remaining contribution balance back to caller
        payable(msg.sender).call{value: contribution}("");

        // Withdraws pending balance of caller if available
        if (pendingBalances[msg.sender] > 0) withdrawBalance();
```

## [G-12] Generate merkle tree offchain

Generate merkle tree onchain is expensive espically when you want to include a large set of value. Consider generating it offchain a publish the root when creating a new pool.

```solidity
        bytes32 merkleRoot = (length == 1) ? bytes32(_tokenIds[0]) : _generateRoot(_tokenIds);
```
[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L71)

## [G-13] Pack Bid Struct

The Bid struct can be packed tighter

```solidity
struct Bid {
    uint256 bidId;
    address owner;
    uint256 price;
    uint256 quantity;
}
```
[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera/blob/f37a11407da2af844bbfe868e1422e3665a5f8e4/src/lib/MinPriorityQueue.sol#L4-L9)

to

```solidity
struct Bid {
    uint96 bidId;
    address owner;
    uint256 price;
    uint256 quantity;
}
```

## [G-14] Pack Queue Struct

```solidity
    struct Queue {
        ///@notice incrementing bid id
        uint256 nextBidId;
        ///@notice array backing priority queue
        uint256[] bidIdList;
        ///@notice total number of bids in queue
        uint256 numBids;
        //@notice map bid ids to bids
        mapping(uint256 => Bid) bidIdToBidMap;
        ///@notice map addreses to bids they own
        mapping(address => uint256[]) ownerToBidIds;
    }
```

to

```solidity
    struct Queue {
        ///@notice incrementing bid id
        uint96 nextBidId;
        ///@notice total number of bids in queue
        uint160 numBids;
        ///@notice array backing priority queue
        uint256[] bidIdList;
        //@notice map bid ids to bids
        mapping(uint256 => Bid) bidIdToBidMap;
        ///@notice map addreses to bids they own

> I like that [#28](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/28) states the amount of gas saved per finding and as a whole. However, this report edges out in gas savings IMO, notably with the struct reorderings + doing merkle proof generation off-chain recommendations.

# Mitigation Review

## Introduction

Following the C4 audit contest, 3 wardens (IllIllI, Lambda, and [gzeon](https://twitter.com/gzeon)) reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues. Additional details can be found within the [C4 Tessera Versus Mitigation Review contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation).

## Mitigation Review Scope

| URL | Mitigation of | Purpose | 
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| [PR 204](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/204) | H-01 | Fixed by checking success value of call. |  
| [PR 207](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/207) | H-02 | Calculate actual minReservePrice after purchase has been made. This is done by simply dividing total filled quantity by the purchase price. This fixes the ETH accounting when the NFT is purchased for less than the minimum reserve price. | 
| [PR 203](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/203) | H-03 | Updated comparison to use <= to avoid edge case for an invalid state. | 
| [PR 202](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/202) | H-04, H-07 | Updated pendingBalances mapping before setting the newly proposed listing. This way, the balance is updated for the previous proposer and the currently proposed listing can be overridden with the new one. | 
| Not fixing | H-05 |  N/A | 
| [PR 211](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/211) | H-06 | Solution is to move orderHash to Listing struct so that active and proposed listings can have separate order hashes. | 
| [PR 201](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/201) | H-08, H-09 | Fixed by moving success state update before call to market buyer. | 
| Not fixing | M-01 |  N/A |

| [PR 206](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/206) | M-03 | If total supply is equal to filled quantities, use min reserved price instead of min price when validating the user contribution. this way, funds will not be stuck until a purchase is made and the user will be able to withdraw their funds right away. | 
| [PR 212](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/212) | M-04, M-08 | Used <= when comparing the new price to the lowest bid price. That way, it can only override the lower bid if price is higher. |

| [PR 213](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/213) | M-09 | Where due to truncation, the stated minimum raised wouldn't result in actually being able to purchase with the full amount raised. Instead of doing that math weâ€™re going to have the initial purchase by the deployer set the initial target. |

## [[MR:H-01] Mitigation doesn't take rounding issue into account](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/21)
*Submitted by [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/21), also found by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/40).*

https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/fc15c85069d8d55cfe840d4c313754c77f18979f/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L198-L199


### Vulnerability details

The [PR](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/pull/207) applies the recommended mitigation from the [original finding (H-02)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/7), but doesn't take into account the rounding issue identified in [M-09](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/49) 

### Impact

If the price the NFT is bought for is not an exact multiple of the `filledQuantities`, there will be a loss of precision, and during the [calculation](https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/fc15c85069d8d55cfe840d4c313754c77f18979f/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L260) of refunds, each user will get back more than they should, which will leave the last user with not enough funds to withdraw. It is much more likely for the price _not_ to be an exact multiple than it is for it to be one, so most `GroupBuy`s will have this issue.

### Proof of Concept

The division will have a loss of precision:
```solidity
        // Calculates actual min reserve price based on purchase price
        minReservePrices[_poolId] = _price / filledQuantity;
```
https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/fc15c85069d8d55cfe840d4c313754c77f18979f/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L198-L199

And the [same example](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/49#issuecomment-1358963067) the judge used in finding M-9 would still apply.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Decrease the total number of Raes if the price is not a multiple of the current total, so that it becomes a multiple.

## [[MR:H-02] Attacker can steal the NFT bought by sending it to another vault he controls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/47)
*Submitted by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/47).*

https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/d0974eef922c3087ed9c1b8d758fe66307734c23/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L214

### Impact

The mitigation of [H-08](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/47) tries to validate the vault returned by _market with the VaultRegistry. However, it's only validated if the vault exists, but not if it is the correct vault. A similar attack described in https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tessera-findings/issues/47 can be carried out by using a valid vault address that is permissionlessly deployed with VaultRegistry.createFor but have the owner set to the attacker.

###  Proof of Concept

https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/d0974eef922c3087ed9c1b8d758fe66307734c23/src/modules/GroupBuy.sol#L214-L215
```solidity
        (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(vault);
        if (id == 0) revert NotVault();
```

1. Group assembles and raises funds to buy NFT X
2. Attacker deploy a valid vault using VaultRegistry.createFor but setting himself as the owner, with a merkle root that enable NFT transfer
3. Attacker calls purchase() and supplies their malicious contract in _market, returning the vault generated above
4. Attacker call Vault.execute in the vault to retrieve the NFT to his own wallet
5. Attacker receives the NFT bought by the raised funds with 0 cost except gas

https://github.com/fractional-company/modular-fractional/blob/9411afcd03d457192adc2bc59b3b378aeddd5865/src/Vault.sol#L36

```solidity
    function execute(
        address _target,
        bytes calldata _data,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external payable returns (bool success, bytes memory response) {
        bytes4 selector;
        assembly {
            selector := calldataload(_data.offset)
        }

        // Generate leaf node by hashing module, target and function selector.
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, _target, selector));
        // Check that the caller is either a module with permission to call or the owner.
        if (!MerkleProof.verify(_proof, MERKLE_ROOT(), leaf)) {
            if (msg.sender != FACTORY() && msg.sender != OWNER())
                revert NotAuthorized(msg.sender, _target, selector);
        }

        (success, response) = _execute(_target, _data);
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Also check the owner of the vault.

**[HickupHH3 (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-tessera-mitigation-findings/issues/47#issuecomment-1413836406):**
>It's clear to me that the vault should be the owner of the NFT. The question I have is, who should be the owner of the vault? Multisig? What address should be considered to be the rightful owner?
>
>> Once the purchase is executed, a new vault gets deployed with the proper permissions, the NFT then gets transferred to the vault, and ownership of the NFT by the vault is verified.
>
>Based on this, given that the market is still a user supplied param, a valid vault can be deployed, but it belongs to an arbitrary owner.
