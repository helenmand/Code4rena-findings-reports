# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Velodrome Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 23â€”May 30 2022.

## Wardens

82 Wardens contributed reports to the Velodrome Finance contest:

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 23 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 6 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 17 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 50 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 51 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Velodrome Finance contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome), and is composed of 17 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 3,443 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (6)
## [[H-01] Users can get unlimited votes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/129)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by kenzo_

Users can get unlimited votes which leads to them:

1.  gaining control over governance
2.  getting undeserved rewards
3.  having their pools favored due to gauge values

### Proof of Concept

`_mint()` calls `_moveTokenDelegates()` to set up delegation...

but `_burn()` does not transfer them back to `address(0)`

```solidity

A user can deposit a token, lock it, wait for the lock to expire, transfer the token to another address, and repeat. During each iteration, a new NFT is minted and checkpointed. Calls to `getPastVotes()` will show the wrong values, since it will think the account still holds the delegation of the burnt NFT. Bribes and gauges also look at the checkpoints and will also have the wrong information

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `_moveTokenDelegates(owner,address(0))` in `_burn()`

## [[H-02] `VotingEscrow`'s merge and withdraw aren't available for approved users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/66)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by hansfriese, rotcivegaf, and WatchPug_

Users who are approved, but do not own a particular NFT, are supposed to be eligible to call merge and withdraw from the NFT.

Currently \_burn(), used by merge() and withdraw() to remove the NFT from the system, will revert unless the sender is the owner of NFT as the function tries to update the accounting for the sender, not the owner.

Setting the severity to medium as the impact is merge() and withdraw() permanent unavailability for any approved sender, who isn't the owner of the involved NFT.

### Proof of Concept

\_removeTokenFrom() requires `_from` to be the NFT owner as it removes `_tokenId` from the `_from` account:

[VotingEscrow.sol#L504-L515](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L504-L515)<br>

```solidity
    /// @dev Remove a NFT from a given address
    ///      Throws if `_from` is not the current owner.
    function _removeTokenFrom(address _from, uint _tokenId) internal {
        // Throws if `_from` is not the current owner
        assert(idToOwner[_tokenId] == _from);
        // Change the owner
        idToOwner[_tokenId] = address(0);
        // Update owner token index tracking
        _removeTokenFromOwnerList(_from, _tokenId);
        // Change count tracking
        ownerToNFTokenCount[_from] -= 1;
    }
```

\_burn() allows `_tokenId` to approved or owner, but calls \_removeTokenFrom() with `msg.sender` as `_from`:

[VotingEscrow.sol#L517-L528](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L517-L528)<br>

```solidity
    function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

        address owner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

        // Clear approval
        approve(address(0), _tokenId);
        // TODO add delegates
        // Remove token
        _removeTokenFrom(msg.sender, _tokenId);
        emit Transfer(owner, address(0), _tokenId);
    }
```

This way if \_burn() is called by an approved account who isn't an owner, it will revert on \_removeTokenFrom()'s `assert(idToOwner[_tokenId] == _from)` check.

Now burn() is used by merge():

[VotingEscrow.sol#L1084-L1097](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1084-L1097)<br>

```solidity
    function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external {
        require(attachments[_from] == 0 && !voted[_from], "attached");
        require(_from != _to);
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _from));
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _to));

        LockedBalance memory _locked0 = locked[_from];
        LockedBalance memory _locked1 = locked[_to];
        uint value0 = uint(int256(_locked0.amount));
        uint end = _locked0.end >= _locked1.end ? _locked0.end : _locked1.end;

        locked[_from] = LockedBalance(0, 0);
        _checkpoint(_from, _locked0, LockedBalance(0, 0));
        _burn(_from);
```

And withdraw():

[VotingEscrow.sol#L842-L864](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L842-L864)<br>

```solidity
    /// @notice Withdraw all tokens for `_tokenId`
    /// @dev Only possible if the lock has expired
    function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(attachments[_tokenId] == 0 && !voted[_tokenId], "attached");

        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
        require(block.timestamp >= _locked.end, "The lock didn't expire");
        uint value = uint(int256(_locked.amount));

        locked[_tokenId] = LockedBalance(0,0);
        uint supply_before = supply;
        supply = supply_before - value;

        // old_locked can have either expired <= timestamp or zero end
        // _locked has only 0 end
        // Both can have >= 0 amount
        _checkpoint(_tokenId, _locked, LockedBalance(0,0));

        assert(IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, value));

        // Burn the NFT
        _burn(_tokenId);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing \_removeTokenFrom() argument to be the owner:

[VotingEscrow.sol#L517-L528](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L517-L528)<br>

```solidity
    function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

        address owner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

        // Clear approval
        approve(address(0), _tokenId);
        // TODO add delegates
        // Remove token
-       _removeTokenFrom(msg.sender, _tokenId);
+       _removeTokenFrom(owner, _tokenId);
        emit Transfer(owner, address(0), _tokenId);
    }
```

## [[H-03] User rewards stop accruing after any `_writeCheckpoint` calling action](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/59)
*Submitted by hyh, also found by smiling_heretic, unforgiven, and xiaoming90*

Any user balance affecting action, i.e. deposit, withdraw/withdrawToken or getReward, calls \_writeCheckpoint to update the balance records used for the earned reward estimation. The issue is that \_writeCheckpoint always sets false to `voted` flag for the each new checkpoint due to wrong index used in the mapping access, while only voted periods are eligible for accruing the rewards.

This way any balance changing action of a voted user will lead to stopping of the rewards accrual for the user, until next vote will be cast. I.e. any action that has no relation to voting and should have only balance change as the reward accruing process impact, in fact removes any future rewards from the user until the next vote.

Setting the severity to be high as the impact here violates system logic and means next periods accrued rewards loss for a user.

### Proof of Concept

\_writeCheckpoint adds a new checkpoint if block.timestamp is not found in the last checkpoint:

[Gauge.sol#L302-L313](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L302-L313)<br>

```solidity
    function _writeCheckpoint(address account, uint balance) internal {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (_nCheckPoints > 0 && checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp) {
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].balanceOf = balance;
        } else {
            bool prevVoteStatus = (_nCheckPoints > 0) ? checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints].voted : false;
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints] = Checkpoint(_timestamp, balance, prevVoteStatus);
            numCheckpoints[account] = _nCheckPoints + 1;
        }
    }
```

However, instead of moving vote status from the previous checkpoint it records `false` to `prevVoteStatus` all the time as last status is `checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints-1].voted`, while `checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints]` isn't created yet and is empty:

[Gauge.sol#L309](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L309)<br>

```solidity
	bool prevVoteStatus = (_nCheckPoints > 0) ? checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints].voted : false;
```

Notice that `checkpoints` is a mapping and no range check violation happens:

[Gauge.sol#L74-L75](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L74-L75)<br>

```solidity
    /// @notice A record of balance checkpoints for each account, by index
    mapping (address => mapping (uint => Checkpoint)) public checkpoints;
```

This will effectively lead to rewards removal on any user action, as earned() used in rewards estimation counts only voted periods:

[Gauge.sol#L483-L502](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L483-L502)<br>

```solidity
        if (_endIndex > 0) {
            for (uint i = _startIndex; i < _endIndex; i++) {
                Checkpoint memory cp0 = checkpoints[account][i];
                Checkpoint memory cp1 = checkpoints[account][i+1];
                (uint _rewardPerTokenStored0,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp0.timestamp);
                (uint _rewardPerTokenStored1,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp1.timestamp);
                if (cp0.voted) {
                    reward += cp0.balanceOf * (_rewardPerTokenStored1 - _rewardPerTokenStored0) / PRECISION;
                }
            }
        }

        Checkpoint memory cp = checkpoints[account][_endIndex];
        uint lastCpWeeksVoteEnd = cp.timestamp - (cp.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG + DURATION;
        if (block.timestamp > lastCpWeeksVoteEnd) {
            (uint _rewardPerTokenStored,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp.timestamp);
            if (cp.voted) {
                reward += cp.balanceOf * (rewardPerToken(token) - Math.max(_rewardPerTokenStored, userRewardPerTokenStored[token][account])) / PRECISION;
            }
        }
```

I.e. if a user has voted, then performed any of the operations that call \_writeCheckpoint update: deposit, withdraw/withdrawToken or getReward, then this user will not have any rewards for the period between this operation and the next vote as all checkpoints that were created by \_writeCheckpoint will have `voted == false`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the index to be `_nCheckPoints-1`:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L309>

```solidity
-	bool prevVoteStatus = (_nCheckPoints > 0) ? checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints].voted : false;
+	bool prevVoteStatus = (_nCheckPoints > 0) ? checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].voted : false;
```

## [[H-04] Bribe Rewards Struck In Contract If Deposited During First Epoch](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/168)
_Submitted by xiaoming90_

Bribe rewards added to the `Bribe` contract in the first epoch will not be claimable by any voters, and the rewards will struck in the `Bribe` contract.

### Proof-of-Concept

Assume that the current epoch is `epoch 0`, and start date of `epoch 0` is `Day 0`.

When a briber adds a new rewards by calling `Bribe.notifyRewardAmount()`, the `Bribe.getEpochStart()` will return the `start date of current epoch (epoch 0) + 1 day (Bribe Lag)`

Thus, `adjustedTstamp` will be set to `Day 1`. `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp]` will evaluate to `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[DAI][Day 1]` and the briber's rewards will be stored in `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[DAI][Day 1]`

[Bribe.sol#L35](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L35)<br>

```solidity
function getEpochStart(uint timestamp) public view returns (uint) {
	uint bribeStart = timestamp - (timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
	uint bribeEnd = bribeStart + DURATION - COOLDOWN;
	return timestamp < bribeEnd ? bribeStart : bribeStart + 7 days;
}
```

[Bribe.sol#L41](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L41)<br>

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
  require(amount > 0);
  if (!isReward[token]) {
	require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
  }
  // bribes kick in at the start of next bribe period
  uint adjustedTstamp = getEpochStart(block.timestamp);
  uint epochRewards = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp];

  _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;

  if (!isReward[token]) {
	  isReward[token] = true;
	  rewards.push(token);
	  IGauge(gauge).addBribeRewardToken(token);
  }

  emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, adjustedTstamp, amount);
}
```

On `Day 6`, the `voting` phase has ended and the state is currently in the `reward` phase. Alice decided to call the `Voter.distribute` to trigger the distribution of bribe rewards.

However, the main issue is that calling the `Voter.distribute`  function on Epoch 0's Day 6 (Reward Phase) will not executed the`Gauge.deliverBribes()` because `claimable[_gauge]` or `_claimable` is currently `0`.

`Gauge.deliverBribes()` is the main function responsible for distributing bribe rewards. Since `Gauge.deliverBribes()` cannot be triggered, the bribe rewards are forever struck in the `Bribe` Contract.

`claimable[_gauge]` will always be zero on the first epoch because the gauge rewards will only come in the later epoch. The value of`claimable[_gauge]` will only increase when the `Minter.update_period()` function starts minting VELO and distribute them to the gauges. Per the source code of [`Minter`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Minter.sol#L46) contract, the VELO emission will only start from third epoch onwards (`active_period = ((block.timestamp + (2 * WEEK)) / WEEK) * WEEK;`). Thus, before the VELO emission, `claimable[_gauge]`will always remain at `0`.

[Voter.sol#L315](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L315)<br>

```solidity
function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
	require(isAlive[_gauge]); // killed gauges cannot distribute
	uint dayCalc = block.timestamp % (7 days);
	require((dayCalc < BRIBE_LAG) || (dayCalc > (DURATION + BRIBE_LAG)), "cannot claim during votes period");
	IMinter(minter).update_period();
	_updateFor(_gauge);
	uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
	if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
		claimable[_gauge] = 0;
		IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
		emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
		// distribute bribes & fees too
		IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();
	}
}
```

If someone attempt to call `Voter.distribute()` on epoch 1 or subsequent epoch, it will fetch the bribe rewards in their respective epoch.

In the `Gauge.deliverBribes` function, the code `uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;` will calculate the start date of current epoch + BRIBE_LAG (1 day). So, if someone call `Gauge.deliverBribes` in epoch 1, the `bribeStart` variable will be set to the `Epoch 1 + 1 day`, which is equivalent to Day 9. There is no way to fetch the bribe rewards struck in epoch 0.

[Gauge.sol#L173](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L173)<br>

```solidity
function deliverBribes() external lock {
	require(msg.sender == voter);
	IBribe sb = IBribe(bribe);
	uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
	uint numRewards = sb.rewardsListLength();

	for (uint i = 0; i < numRewards; i++) {
		address token = sb.rewards(i);
		uint epochRewards = sb.deliverReward(token, bribeStart);
		if (epochRewards > 0) {
			_notifyBribeAmount(token, epochRewards, bribeStart);
		}
	}
}
```

[Bribe.sol#L83](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L83)<br>

```solidity
function deliverReward(address token, uint epochStart) external lock returns (uint) {
	require(msg.sender == gauge);
	uint rewardPerEpoch = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart];
	if (rewardPerEpoch > 0) {
	  _safeTransfer(token, address(gauge), rewardPerEpoch);
	}
	return rewardPerEpoch;
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement logic to handle the edge case where bribe rewards are added during first epoch. Consider aligning the start of bribe period with VELO emission period.

## [[H-05] Voting overwrites `checkpoint.voted` in last checkpoint, so users can just vote right before claiming rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/206)
*Submitted by smiling_heretic*

[Gauge.sol#L195](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L195)<br>
[Gauge.sol#L489-L490](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L489-L490)<br>
[Gauge.sol#L499-L500](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L499-L500)

```
            if (cp0.voted) {
                reward += cp0.balanceOf * (_rewardPerTokenStored1 - _rewardPerTokenStored0) / PRECISION;
```

this line in `gauge.earned` function looks like the intention here is to incentivize users to keep their `escrow.balanceOfNft` voted for this gauge.

However, it's enough to vote just before claiming rewards (even in the same transaction) and `voter.reset` just after receiving rewards to pass this `if` and get rewards for full period since last interaction with the gauge.

### Proof of Concept

See [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/206) for test file.

Note, that Bob kept his votes for this gauge for full 6-day period but Alice just voted before claiming rewards. In logs, we can see that they both received the same (non-zero) amount of VELO tokens.

Alice can reset her votes in the same transaction after claiming rewards, if she decides to do so.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A partial solution would be to create a new checkpoint each time user's `voted` status changes (`setVoteStatus` is called) instead of overwriting the `voted` in last one.

However, even then, users can just assign very small weight to this gauge, and lock very little VELO, so I don't think this `if` statement helps with anything. I think, it's better to rethink how to incentivize users to vote for specific gauges.

## [[H-06] Attacker can block LayerZero channel](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/83)
_Submitted by Ruhum_

According to the LayerZero docs, the default behavior is that when a transaction on the destination application fails, the channel between the src and dst app is blocked. Before any new transactions can be executed, the failed transaction has to be retried until it succeeds.

See <https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/messaging-properties#message-ordering> & <https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/guides/advanced/nonblockinglzapp>

So an attacker is able to initiate a transaction they know will fail to block the channel between FTM and Optimism. The RedemptionSender & Receiver won't be usable anymore.

### Proof of Concept

The RedemptionReceiver contract doesn't implement the non-blocking approach as seen here:<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/main/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionReceiver.sol#L72-L105>

An example implementation of the non-blocking approach by LayerZero:<br>
<https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/main/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the non-blocking approach as described [here](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/guides/advanced/nonblockinglzapp).

# Medium Risk Findings (17)
## [[M-01] Gauge set can be front run if bribe and gauge constructors aren't run atomically](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/54)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by 0x1f8b_

If Bribe and Gauge constructors are run not in the same transaction, the griefing attack is possible. A malicious user can run setGauge after Bribe, but before Gauge constructor, making Bribe contract unusable. The fix here is Bribe redeployment.

Setting severity to be medium as that is temporary system breaking impact.

### Proof of Concept

setGauge can be run by anyone, but only once with a meaningful gauge:

[Bribe.sol#L30-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L30-L33)<br>

```solidity
  function setGauge(address _gauge) external {
    require(gauge == address(0), "gauge already set");
    gauge = _gauge;
  }
```

Now it is called in Gauge constructor:

[Gauge.sol#L96-L104](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L96-L104)<br>

```solidity
    constructor(address _stake, address _bribe, address  __ve, address _voter, bool _isForPair) {
        stake = _stake;
        bribe = _bribe;
        _ve = __ve;
        voter = _voter;

        factory = msg.sender;

        IBribe(bribe).setGauge(address(this));
```

This way it will not be called before Gauge constructor, but if it is not atomic with Bribe constructor, an attacker can call in-between.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider either running Bribe and then Gauge constructors atomically, or introducing an owner role in Bribe constructor and onlyOwner access control in setGauge, setting it manually.

setProposalNumerator and setTeam functions of the VeloGovernor contract can only be called by team without allowing governance to call.

## [[M-03] Alter velo receptions computation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/36)
_Submitted by 0x1f8b, also found by hansfriese_

The `deployer` can modify the values to obtain different values than expected.

### Proof of Concept

The flag used in `initializeReceiverWith` to prevent re-initialization is `fantomSender == address(0)`, however the provided address for that value is not checked to be different from `address(0)`, so it could be initialized multiple times to establish that value.

This could allow minting multiple Velos into [Velo.mintToRedemptionReceiver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/731a7c438c4f93efc8310586d217006930be63fd/contracts/contracts/Velo.sol#L74) and setting the wrong value in `redeemableVELO` and `redeemableUSDC` to affect the calculations of the `previewRedeem` method and later receive larger amounts of tokens in `lzReceive` than expected.

Affected source code:

*   [RedemptionReceiver.sol#L44](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/731a7c438c4f93efc8310586d217006930be63fd/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionReceiver.sol#L44)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-04] Malicious user can populate `rewards` array with tokens of their interest reaching limits of `MAX_REWARD_TOKENS`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/182)
_Submitted by 0xf15ers, also found by 0x52, berndartmueller, cccz, horsefacts, hyh, minhquanym, pauliax, Ruhum, and WatchPug_

Malicious user can populate `rewards` array with different tokens early reaching limit of `MAX_REWARD_TOKENS` sending very small amount of different tokens. It will restrict any other tokens to be used as `rewards` in [Bribe.sol#notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L41)

### Proof of Concept

A custom malicious contract can be created that can make multiple calls to `notifyRewardAmount()` sending very small amounts of different tokens to populate the array `rewards` and fulfill the total of `MAX_REWARD_TOKENS` . This will restrict any other person from adding to `rewards` array.

## [[M-05] `Bribe.sol` is not meant to handle fee-on-transfer tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/222)
_Submitted by MiloTruck, also found by 0x52, Dravee, IllIllI, MaratCerby, unforgiven, and WatchPug_

[Bribe.sol#L50-L51](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L50-L51)<br>
[Bribe.sol#L83-L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L83-L90)<br>

Should a fee-on-transfer token be added as a reward token and deposited, the tokens will be locked in the `Bribe` contract. Voters will be unable to withdraw their rewards.

### Proof of Concept

Tokens are deposited into the `Bribe` contract using `notifyRewardAmount()`, where `amount` of tokens are transferred, then added directly to `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp]`:

```js
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;
```

Tokens are transferred out of the `Bribe` contract using `deliverReward()`, which attempts to transfer `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` amount of tokens out.

```js
function deliverReward(address token, uint epochStart) external lock returns (uint) {
    require(msg.sender == gauge);
    uint rewardPerEpoch = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart];
    if (rewardPerEpoch > 0) {
        _safeTransfer(token, address(gauge), rewardPerEpoch);
    }
    return rewardPerEpoch;
}
```

If `token` happens to be a fee-on-transfer token, `deliverReward()` will always fail. For example:

*   User calls `notifyRewardAmount()`, with `token` as token that charges a 2% fee upon any transfer, and `amount = 100`:
    *   `_safeTransferFrom()` only transfers 98 tokens to the contract due to the 2% fee
    *   Assuming `epochRewards = 0`, `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp]` becomes `100`
*   Later on, when `deliverReward()` is called with the same `token` and `epochStart`:
    *   `rewardPerEpoch = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart] = 100`
    *   `_safeTransfer` attempts to transfer 100 tokens out of the contract
    *   However, the contract only contains 98 tokens
    *   `deliverReward()` reverts

The following test, which implements a [MockERC20 with fee-on-transfer](https://gist.github.com/MiloTruck/6fe0a13c4d08689b8be8a55b9b14e7e1), demonstrates this:

```js
// Note that the following test was adapted from Bribes.t.sol
function testFailFeeOnTransferToken() public {
    // Deploy ERC20 token with fee-on-transfer
    MockERC20Fee FEE_TOKEN = new MockERC20Fee("FEE", "FEE", 18);

    // Mint FEE token for address(this)
    FEE_TOKEN.mint(address(this), 1e25);
    
    // vote
    VELO.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);
    escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, 4 * 365 * 86400);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

    address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
    pools[0] = address(pair);
    uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](1);
    weights[0] = 10000;
    voter.vote(1, pools, weights);

    // and deposit into the gauge!
    pair.approve(address(gauge), 1e9);
    gauge.deposit(1e9, 1);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 12 hours); // still prior to epoch start
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    assertEq(uint(gauge.getVotingStage(block.timestamp)), uint(Gauge.VotingStage.BribesPhase));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 12 hours); // start of epoch
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    assertEq(uint(gauge.getVotingStage(block.timestamp)), uint(Gauge.VotingStage.VotesPhase));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days); // votes period over
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);

    vm.warp(2 weeks + 1); // emissions start
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);

    minter.update_period();
    distributor.claim(1); // yay this works

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days); // next votes period start
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);

    // get a bribe
    owner.approve(address(FEE_TOKEN), address(bribe), TOKEN_1);
    bribe.notifyRewardAmount(address(FEE_TOKEN), TOKEN_1);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days); // votes period over
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);

    // Atttempt to claim tokens will revert
    voter.distro(); // bribe gets deposited in the gauge
}
```

### Additional Impact

On a larger scale, a malicious attacker could temporarily DOS any `Gauge` contract. This can be done by:

1.  Depositing a fee-on-transfer token into its respective `Bribe` contract, using `notifyRewardAmount()`, and adding it as a reward token.
2.  This would cause `deliverBribes()` to fail whenever it is called, thus no one would be able to withdraw any reward tokens from the `Gauge` contract.

The only way to undo the DOS would be to call `swapOutBribeRewardToken()` and swap out the fee-on-transfer token for another valid token.

### Recommended Mitigation

*   The amount of tokens received should be added to `epochRewards` and stored in `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp]`, instead of the amount stated for transfer. For example:

```js
    uint256 _before = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 _after = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

    tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + (_after - _before);
```

*   Alternatively, disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as reward tokens.

## [[M-06] Voting tokens may be lost when given to non-EOA accounts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/185)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by rotcivegaf and Ruhum_

veNFTs may be sent to contracts that cannot handle them, and therefore all rewards and voting power, as well as the underlying are locked forever

### Proof of Concept

The original code had the following warning:

```solidity
    * @dev Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
    * are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.
```

[ve.sol#L143-L144](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/eac1ef02ca8736138b25062c02646ea43d5bb6e4/contracts/ve.sol#L143-L144)<br>

The minting code, which creates the locks, does not do this check:

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol   #1

462       function _mint(address _to, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
463           // Throws if `_to` is zero address
464           assert(_to != address(0));
465           // TODO add delegates
466           // checkpoint for gov
467           _moveTokenDelegates(address(0), delegates(_to), _tokenId);
468           // Add NFT. Throws if `_tokenId` is owned by someone
469           _addTokenTo(_to, _tokenId);
470           emit Transfer(address(0), _to, _tokenId);
471           return true;
472       }
```

Once a lock is already minted, if it's transfered to a contract, the code does attempt to check for the issue:

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol   #2

378       ///      If `_to` is a smart contract, it calls `onERC721Received` on `_to` and throws if
379       ///      the return value is not `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint,bytes)"))`.
380       /// @param _from The current owner of the NFT.
381       /// @param _to The new owner.
382       /// @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer.
383       /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `_to`.
384       function safeTransferFrom(
385           address _from,
386           address _to,
387           uint _tokenId,
388           bytes memory _data
389       ) public {
390           _transferFrom(_from, _to, _tokenId, msg.sender);
391   
392           if (_isContract(_to)) {
393               // Throws if transfer destination is a contract which does not implement 'onERC721Received'
394               try IERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, _from, _tokenId, _data) returns (bytes4) {} catch (
395                   bytes memory reason
396               ) {
397                   if (reason.length == 0) {
398                       revert('ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer');
399                   } else {
400                       assembly {
401                           revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))

403                   }
404               }
405           }
406       }
```

[VotingEscrow.sol#L378-L406](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L378-L406)<br>

While the transfer function does in fact execute `onERC721Received`, it doesn't actually do a check of the `bytes4` variable - it only checks for a non-zero length. The ERC721 standard says that for the function call to be valid, it must return the `bytes4` function selector, otherwise it's invalid. If a user of the escrow system uses a contract that is attempting to explicitly reject NFTs by returning zero in its `onERC721Received()` function, the `VotingEscrow` will interpret that response as success and will transfer the NFT, potentially locking it forever. If the lock is minted to a contract, no checks are done, and the NFT can be locked forever.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `onERC721Received()` in `_mint()` and ensure that the return value equals `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector` in both `_mint()` and `safeTransferFrom()`.

## [[M-07] `RedemptionSender` should estimate fees to prevent failed transactions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/80)
_Submitted by Ruhum_

[RedemptionSender.sol#L43](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/main/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionSender.sol#L43)<br>

When sending a msg to the layer zero endpoint you include enough gas for the transaction. If you don't include enough tokens for the gas, the transaction will fail. The RedemptionSender contract allows the user to pass any value they want which might result in them sending not enough. Their transaction will fail.

To know how much you have to send there's the `estimateFees()` function as described [here](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/guides/code-examples/estimating-message-fees).

### Proof of Concept

```sol
    function redeemWEVE(
        uint256 amount,
        address zroPaymentAddress,
        bytes memory zroTransactionParams
    ) public payable {
        require(amount != 0, "AMOUNT_ZERO");
        require(
            IERC20(weve).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD,
                amount
            ),
            "WEVE: TRANSFER_FAILED"
        );

        ILayerZeroEndpoint(endpoint).send{value: msg.value}(
            optimismChainId,
            abi.encodePacked(optimismReceiver),
            abi.encode(msg.sender, amount),
            payable(msg.sender),
            zroPaymentAddress,
            zroTransactionParams
        );
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the `estimateFees()` endpoint.

## [[M-08] Temporary DOS by calling `notifyRewardAmount()` in Bribe/Gauge with malicious tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/138)
_Submitted by unforgiven, also found by 0x52 and Picodes_

[Bribe.sol#L41-L60](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L41-L60)<br>
[Gauge.sol#L590-L624](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L590-L624)<br>

It's possible to call `notifyRewardAmount()` in `Bribe` or `Gauge` contract with malicious tokens and contract will add them to reward tokens list and then attacker can interrupt `Gauge.deliverBribes()` logic (by failing all contract transaction in that malicious token). because `Gauge.deliverBribes()` is looping through all tokens and transferring rewards and if one of them fails whole transaction will fail.<br>
As `Gauge.deliverBribes()` is called by `Voter.distribute()` and `Voter.distribute()` is called by `Gauge.getReward()` so functions: `Voter.distribute()` and `Gauge.getReward()` will be broke too and no one can call them for that `Gauge`.

### Proof of Concept

This is `notifyRewardAmount()` code in `Bribe`:

      function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
          require(amount > 0);
          if (!isReward[token]) {
            require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
          }
          // bribes kick in at the start of next bribe period
          uint adjustedTstamp = getEpochStart(block.timestamp);
          uint epochRewards = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp];

          _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;

          if (!isReward[token]) {
              isReward[token] = true;
              rewards.push(token);
              IGauge(gauge).addBribeRewardToken(token);
          }

          emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, adjustedTstamp, amount);
      }

As you can see it's callable by anyone and it will add the new tokens to `rewards` list in `Bribe` and `Gauge` contract. `notifyRewardAmount()` in `Gauge` is similar to `Bribe`'s `notifyRewardAmount()`.<br>
This is `deliverBribes()` code in `Gauge`:

        function deliverBribes() external lock {
            require(msg.sender == voter);
            IBribe sb = IBribe(bribe);
            uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
            uint numRewards = sb.rewardsListLength();

            for (uint i = 0; i < numRewards; i++) {
                address token = sb.rewards(i);
                uint epochRewards = sb.deliverReward(token, bribeStart);
                if (epochRewards > 0) {
                    _notifyBribeAmount(token, epochRewards, bribeStart);
                }
            }
        }

As you can see it loops through all `rewards` token list and calls `Bribe.deliverReward()` which then transfers the reward token. but if one of the tokens were malicious and revert the transaction then the whole transaction will fail and `deliverBribes()` logic will be blocked.
This is `distribute()` code in `Voter`:

        function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
            require(isAlive[_gauge]); // killed gauges cannot distribute
            uint dayCalc = block.timestamp % (7 days);
            require((dayCalc < BRIBE_LAG) || (dayCalc > (DURATION + BRIBE_LAG)), "cannot claim during votes period");
            IMinter(minter).update_period();
            _updateFor(_gauge);
            uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
            if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
                claimable[_gauge] = 0;
                IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
                emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
                // distribute bribes & fees too
                IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();
            }
        }

As you can see it calls `Gauge.deliverBribes()`. and this is `getReward()` code in `Gauge`:

        function getReward(address account, address[] memory tokens) external lock {
            require(msg.sender == account || msg.sender == voter);
            _unlocked = 1;
            IVoter(voter).distribute(address(this));
            _unlocked = 2;

            for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
                (rewardPerTokenStored[tokens[i]], lastUpdateTime[tokens[i]]) = _updateRewardPerToken(tokens[i]);

                uint _reward = earned(tokens[i], account);
                lastEarn[tokens[i]][account] = block.timestamp;
                userRewardPerTokenStored[tokens[i]][account] = rewardPerTokenStored[tokens[i]];
                if (_reward > 0) _safeTransfer(tokens[i], account, _reward);

                emit ClaimRewards(msg.sender, tokens[i], _reward);
            }

            uint _derivedBalance = derivedBalances[account];
            derivedSupply -= _derivedBalance;
            _derivedBalance = derivedBalance(account);
            derivedBalances[account] = _derivedBalance;
            derivedSupply += _derivedBalance;

            _writeCheckpoint(account, derivedBalances[account]);
            _writeSupplyCheckpoint();
        }

which calls `Voter.distribute()`. so if `Gauge.deliverBribes()` fails then the logic of `Voter.distribute()` and `Gauge.getReward()` will fail too and users couldn't call them and attacker can cause DOS.
Of course the `team` can swap those malicious reward tokens added by attacker with `swapOutRewardToken()` and `swapOutBribeRewardToken()` but for some time those logics will not work and attacker can cause DOS.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set access levels for `notifyRewardAmount()` functions.

## [[M-09] Owner's delegates should be decreased in `_burn()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/153)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

```solidity
function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

    address owner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

    // Clear approval
    approve(address(0), _tokenId);
    // TODO add delegates
    // Remove token
    _removeTokenFrom(msg.sender, _tokenId);
    emit Transfer(owner, address(0), _tokenId);
}
```

[VotingEscrow.sol#L1244-L1248](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1244-L1248)<br>

```solidity
// All the same plus _tokenId
require(
    dstRepOld.length + 1 <= MAX_DELEGATES,
    "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
);
```

When `_moveTokenDelegates()`, `dstRep` must not have more than `MAX_DELEGATES`.

However, in `_burn()`, `dstRep` array wont get decreased. This opens a griefing attack vector, in which the attacker can deposit 1 wei of token for the victim, repeated for `MAX_DELEGATES` times, and the victim can no longer deposit, even if they try to merge or burn their tokenIds.

Even for a normal active user, this can be a problem as the `dstRep` array will continuously grow and cant decrease, one day the user won't be able to deposit anymore as they have reached the `MAX_DELEGATES` cap.

### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

    address owner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

    // Clear approval
    approve(address(0), _tokenId);

## [[M-10] Rewards aren't updated before user's balance change in Gauge's `withdrawToken`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by codexploder_

\_updateRewardForAllTokens is called in withdraw() only, while both withdraw() and withdrawToken() are public and can be called directly. Reward update is needed on user's balance change, its absence leads to reward data rewriting and rewards losing impact for a user.

Per discussion with project withdrawToken() will not be exposed in UI, so setting the severity to be medium as user's direct usage of the vulnerable function is required here, while the impact is losing of a part of accumulated rewards.

### Proof of Concept

withdraw() is a wrapper for withdrawToken(), which changes user's balance. withdrawToken() can be called directly, and in this case there will be no rewards update:

[Gauge.sol#L548-L561](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L548-L561)<br>

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        _updateRewardForAllTokens();

        uint tokenId = 0;
        if (amount == balanceOf[msg.sender]) {
            tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
        }
        withdrawToken(amount, tokenId);
    }

    function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
        totalSupply -= amount;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _safeTransfer(stake, msg.sender, amount);
```

This way if a user call withdrawToken(), the associated rewards can be lost due to incomplete reward balance accounting.

### References

A showcase of reward update issue: <https://github.com/belbix/solidly/issues/1><br>

It's replicated live with users losing accumulated rewards: <https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/issues/55><br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider moving rewards update to withdrawToken(), since it is called by withdraw() anyway:

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
-       _updateRewardForAllTokens();

        uint tokenId = 0;
        if (amount == balanceOf[msg.sender]) {
            tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
        }
        withdrawToken(amount, tokenId);
    }

    function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
+    	_updateRewardForAllTokens();

        totalSupply -= amount;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _safeTransfer(stake, msg.sender, amount);
```

Or, if the intent is to keep withdrawToken() as is, consider making it private, so no direct usage be possible:

```solidity

-    function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
+    function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) private lock {

        totalSupply -= amount;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _safeTransfer(stake, msg.sender, amount);
```

## [[M-11] Griefing Attack By Extending The Reward Duration](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/172)
_Submitted by xiaoming90_

The `Gauge.notifyRewardAmount` notifies the contract of a newly received rewards. This updates the local accounting and streams the reward over a preset period (Five days).

It was observed that this function is callable by anyone regardless of whether the previous reward period has already expired or not. Thus, it would be possible to exploit the system by repeatedly calling it with dust reward amount to extend an active reward period, and thus dragging out the duration over which the rewards are released.

Since Velodrome is to be deployed on Layer 2 blockchain where the gas fee tends to be cheap, the effort required to carry out this attack would be minimal.

This issue was also highlighted in Curve documentation under the [`ChildChainStreamer.notify_reward_amount(token: address):`](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges-sidechain.html) section.

[Gauge.sol#L590](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L590)<br>

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    require(token != stake);
    require(amount > 0);
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
    }
    // rewards accrue only during the bribe period
    uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
    uint adjustedTstamp = block.timestamp < bribeStart ? bribeStart : bribeStart + 7 days;
    if (rewardRate[token] == 0) _writeRewardPerTokenCheckpoint(token, 0, adjustedTstamp);
    (rewardPerTokenStored[token], lastUpdateTime[token]) = _updateRewardPerToken(token);
    _claimFees();

    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
        _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
    } else {
        uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
        uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
        require(amount > _left);
        _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
    }
    require(rewardRate[token] > 0);
    uint balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / DURATION, "Provided reward too high");
    periodFinish[token] = adjustedTstamp + DURATION;
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        isReward[token] = true;
        rewards.push(token);
        IBribe(bribe).addRewardToken(token);
    }

    emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, amount);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing validation to ensure that this function is callable by anyone only if the previous reward period has already expired. Otherwise, when there is an active reward period, it may only be called by the designated reward distributor account.

For sample implementation, see [here](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/3bee979b7b6293c9e7654ee7dfbf5cc9ff40ca58/contracts/streamers/ChildChainStreamer.vy#L166).

## [[M-12] Rewards can be locked in Bribe contract because distributing them depends on base token reward amount and `Gauge.deliverBribes()` is not always called by `Voter.distribute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/158)
_Submitted by unforgiven_

[Voter.sol#L315-L329](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L315-L329)<br>

`Voter.distribute()` calls `Gauge.deliverBribes()` if `claimable[_gauge] / DURATION > 0` was `True` and `claimable[_gauge]` shows `base` token rewards for `gauge`. `Gauge.deliverBribes()` calls `Bribe.deliverReward()` which transfers the rewards to `Gauge`. so for `Bribe` rewards to been transferred and distributed `claimable[_gauge] / DURATION > 0` most be `True` and if there was some new rewards in `Bribe` and that condition is not `True` then those rewards will stuck in `Bribe` contract.

### Proof of Concept

This is `Voter.distribute()` code:

        function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
            require(isAlive[_gauge]); // killed gauges cannot distribute
            uint dayCalc = block.timestamp % (7 days);
            require((dayCalc < BRIBE_LAG) || (dayCalc > (DURATION + BRIBE_LAG)), "cannot claim during votes period");
            IMinter(minter).update_period();
            _updateFor(_gauge);
            uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
            if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
                claimable[_gauge] = 0;
                IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
                emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
                // distribute bribes & fees too
                IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();
            }
        }

As you can see `IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();`  is inside and `if` which checks `_claimable / DURATION > 0` for that `Gauge`. `Bribe` is transferring rewards in `Bribe.deliverReward()` which is called by `Gauge.deliverBribes()` and it is called by `Voter.distribute()` if some `base` token claimable amount of that `Gauge` is bigger than `DURATION`, so if this condition isn't true, then rewards in `Bribe` for that epoch will stuck in `Bribe`.<br>
`Voter.distribute()` can be called multiple times in each time `claimable[_gauge]` will set to `0` so if `Bribe` rewards was after that call then those rewards will stuck in `Bribe` for sure.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Move the line `IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();` out of `If` in `Voter.distribute()`.

## [[M-13] Bribe Rewards Not Collected In Current Period Will Be Lost Forever](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/171)
_Submitted by xiaoming90_

It was observed that if the bribe rewards are not collected in the current period, they will not be accrued to future epoch, and they will be lost forever.

### Proof-of-Concept

When a briber adds in a new bribe reward, the reward information are stored in the `Bribe.tokenRewardsPerEpoch` mapping. This mapping stored the number of rewards tokens per epoch.

Assume that a briber adds 100 DAI token as bribe reward in epoch 0 (current epoch), they will be stored in:

`tokenRewardsPerEpoch[DAI][Epoch0+1(Bribe Lag)] = 100 DAI tokens`

[Bribe.sol#L41](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L41)<br>

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    require(amount > 0);
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
    }
    // bribes kick in at the start of next bribe period
    uint adjustedTstamp = getEpochStart(block.timestamp);
    uint epochRewards = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp];

    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][adjustedTstamp] = epochRewards + amount;

    if (!isReward[token]) {
        isReward[token] = true;
        rewards.push(token);
        IGauge(gauge).addBribeRewardToken(token);
    }

    emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, adjustedTstamp, amount);
}
```

The  `Voter.distribute()`function only allows users to distribute the bribe rewards in the current epoch. Calling the`Voter.distribute` function will in turn trigger the `Gauge.deliverBribes` function.

In the `Gauge.deliverBribes` function, the code `uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;` will always return the start date of current epoch + BRIBE_LAG (1 day).  So, if someone call `Gauge.deliverBribes` in epoch 1, the `bribeStart` variable will be set to the `Epoch 1 + 1 day`. Due to the above method of fetching bribe rewards and the use of per epoch's reward mapping, there is no way to fetch the bribe rewards in the previous epoch(s).

Assume that no one triggered the `Voter.distribute()` in epoch 0, the 100 DAI tokens bribe rewards will be lost forever.

[Gauge.sol#L173](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L173)<br>

```solidity
uint internal constant BRIBE_LAG = 1 days;

function deliverBribes() external lock {
    require(msg.sender == voter);
    IBribe sb = IBribe(bribe);
    uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
    uint numRewards = sb.rewardsListLength();

    for (uint i = 0; i < numRewards; i++) {
        address token = sb.rewards(i);
        // @audit - This will transfer the bribe reward token from the Bribe contract to Gauge contract
        uint epochRewards = sb.deliverReward(token, bribeStart);
        if (epochRewards > 0) {
        	// @audit - Update the reward rate accordingly
            _notifyBribeAmount(token, epochRewards, bribeStart);
        }
    }
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Devise a new implementation to allow bribe rewards not collected to be accured to future epochs so that the bribe rewards will not be lost. Consider referencing the Solidy's [`Bribe`](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/eac1ef02ca8736138b25062c02646ea43d5bb6e4/contracts/BaseV1-bribes.sol#L30) contract, which support these requirements.

## [[M-14] Wrong reward distribution in Bribe because `deliverReward()` won't set `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` to 0 ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/141)
*Submitted by unforgiven, also found by csanuragjain, p_crypt0, and smiling_heretic*

[Bribe.sol#L83-L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Bribe.sol#L83-L90)<br>

Function `deliverReward()` in `Bribe` contract won't set `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` to `0` after transferring rewards. `Gauge.getReward()` calls `Voter.distribute()` which calls `Gauge.deliverBribes()` which calls `Bribe.deliverReward()`. so if `Gauge.getReward()` or `Voter.distribute()` get called multiple times in same epoch then `deliverReward()` will transfer `Bribe` tokens multiple times because it doesn't set `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` to `0` after transferring.

### Proof of Concept

This is `deliverReward()` code in `Bribe`:

      function deliverReward(address token, uint epochStart) external lock returns (uint) {
        require(msg.sender == gauge);
        uint rewardPerEpoch = tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart];
        if (rewardPerEpoch > 0) {
          _safeTransfer(token, address(gauge), rewardPerEpoch);
        }
        return rewardPerEpoch;
      }

As you can see it doesn't set `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` value to `0`, so if this function get called multiple times it will transfer epoch rewards multiple times (it will use other epoch's rewards tokens).<br>
function `Gauge.deliverBribes()` calls `Bribe.deliverReward()` and  `Gauge.deliverBribes()` is called by `Voter.distribute()` if the condition `claimable[_gauge] > DURATION` is `True`. This is those functions codes:

        function deliverBribes() external lock {
            require(msg.sender == voter);
            IBribe sb = IBribe(bribe);
            uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
            uint numRewards = sb.rewardsListLength();

            for (uint i = 0; i < numRewards; i++) {
                address token = sb.rewards(i);
                uint epochRewards = sb.deliverReward(token, bribeStart);
                if (epochRewards > 0) {
                    _notifyBribeAmount(token, epochRewards, bribeStart);
                }
            }
        }

<!---->

        function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
            require(isAlive[_gauge]); // killed gauges cannot distribute
            uint dayCalc = block.timestamp % (7 days);
            require((dayCalc < BRIBE_LAG) || (dayCalc > (DURATION + BRIBE_LAG)), "cannot claim during votes period");
            IMinter(minter).update_period();
            _updateFor(_gauge);
            uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
            if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
                claimable[_gauge] = 0;
                IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
                emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
                // distribute bribes & fees too
                IGauge(_gauge).deliverBribes();
            }
        }

also `Gauge.getReward()` calls `Voter.getReward()`.<br>
condition `claimable[_gauge] > DURATION` in `Voter.distribute()` can be true multiple time in one epoch (`deliverBribes()` would be called multiple times) because `claimable[_gauge]` is based on `index` and `index` increase by `notifyRewardAmount()` in `Voter` anytime.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set `tokenRewardsPerEpoch[token][epochStart]` to `0` in `deliverReward`.

## [[M-15] Wrong calculation for the new `rewardRate[token]` can cause some of the late users can not get their rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/186)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

```solidity
uint bribeStart = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % (7 days)) + BRIBE_LAG;
uint adjustedTstamp = block.timestamp < bribeStart ? bribeStart : bribeStart + 7 days;
if (rewardRate[token] == 0) _writeRewardPerTokenCheckpoint(token, 0, adjustedTstamp);
(rewardPerTokenStored[token], lastUpdateTime[token]) = _updateRewardPerToken(token);
_claimFees();

if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
} else {
    uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
    uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
    require(amount > _left);
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
}
```

In `Gauge.sol#notifyRewardAmount()`, the updated rewardRate for the token: `rewardRate[token]` is calculated based on the newly added amount of tokens (`amount`), the remaining amount of existing rewards (`_left`), and the `DURATION`.

While the DURATION is `5 days`, the period from the current time to `periodFinish[token]` is much longer.

`rewardPerToken()` is calculated based on the current time, `lastUpdateTime[token]`, and `rewardRate[token]`.

[Gauge.sol#L375-L380](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L375-L380)<br>

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address token) public view returns (uint) {
    if (derivedSupply == 0) {
        return rewardPerTokenStored[token];
    }
    return rewardPerTokenStored[token] + ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(token) - Math.min(lastUpdateTime[token], periodFinish[token])) * rewardRate[token] * PRECISION / derivedSupply);
}
```

`lastUpdateTime[token]` will frequently be updated to the current timestamp by `_updateRewardForAllTokens()`.

See: [Gauge.sol#L460-L469](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/Gauge.sol#L460-L469)<br>

As a result, `rewardPerToken()` can be much higher than expected, which makes the total amount of reward tokens less than the total amount of rewards accumulated by all the users.

This makes the users who claim the rewards later unable to retrieve their rewards as the balance can be insufficient.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice and Bob both deposited `1,000` stake token to Gauge at `1653091200` (May 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000)

2.  Admin called `notifyRewardAmount()` add 1,000 DAI at `1653100000` (May 21 2022 02:26:40 GMT+0000)

*   `bribeStart` = 1653004800 (May 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000)
*   `adjustedTstamp` = 1653609600 (May 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000)
*   `periodFinish[DAI]` = 1654041600 (Jun 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000)
*   `lastUpdateTime[DAI]` = 1653100000
*   `rewardRate[DAI]` = 1,000 \* 1e18 / 432000 = 2314814814814815

3.  Alice withdrawn and `getReward()` at `1654041800` Jun 01 2022 00:03:20 GMT+0000, get \~1,000 DAI

*   `rewardPerTokenStored[DAI]` = \~1e18

4.  Bob tried to `getReward()`, the transaction will revert due to insufficient balance.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider calculating `rewardRate` base on timeUntilNextPeriodFinish to next period finish:

```solidity
uint nextPeriodFinish = adjustedTstamp + DURATION;
uint timeUntilNextPeriodFinish = nextPeriodFinish - block.timestamp;
if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    rewardRate[token] = amount / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
} else {
    uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
    uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
    require(amount > _left);
    _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
}
require(rewardRate[token] > 0);
uint balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish, "Provided reward too high");
periodFinish[token] = nextPeriodFinish;
```

## [[M-16] Wrong `DOMAIN_TYPEHASH` definition](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/114)
_Submitted by rotcivegaf_

Broke the [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), and the `delegateBySig` function.

### Proof of Concept

In the build of the `DOMAIN TYPEHASH` the `string version` is forgotten, but the `delegateBySig` function, build the `domainSeparator` with the `string version`.

Some contract or dapp/backend could building the `DOMAIN_TYPEHASH` with *"rigth"* struct(include the `version`) and try to use the `delegateBySig` function but this function will revert in the L1378 with the message `"VotingEscrow::delegateBySig: invalid signature"` because the expect `DOMAIN_TYPEHASH` in the `VotingEscrow.sol` contract was built with the *"wrong"* struct.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Acording the [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), in the [Definition of domainSeparator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md#definition-of-domainseparator):

*   *"`string version` the current major version of the signing domain. Signatures from different versions are not compatible"*

Add `string version`, to the `EIP712Domain` string, [L1106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1106):

```solidity
bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");
```

### Other Recommendation

Build the `domainSeparator` [L1362](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1362) in the constructor to save gas and clarify/clean code

1.  Remove the `bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH` [L1106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1106)
2.  Add `bytes32 private immutable DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` as a contract VAR
3.  Assign the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` in the constructor
4.  Use the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` in `delegateBySig` function when buil the `bytes32 digest`

```solidity
contract VotingEscrow is IERC721, IERC721Metadata, IVotes {

    ...

    /* DELETE THIS LINE
    bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");
    */
    bytes32 private immutable DOMAIN_SEPARATOR;

    ...

    constructor(address token_addr) {
        bytes32 domainTypeHash = keccak256(
            "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
        );
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                domainTypeHash,
                keccak256(bytes(name)),
                keccak256(bytes(version)),
                block.chainid,
                address(this)
            )
        );

    ...

    function delegateBySig(
        address delegatee,
        uint nonce,
        uint expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) public {
        bytes32 structHash = keccak256(
            abi.encode(DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, delegatee, nonce, expiry)
        );
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, structHash)
        );

    ...
```

## [[M-17] WeVE (FTM) may be lost forever if redemption process is failed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/90)
_Submitted by Chom_

[RedemptionSender.sol#L28-L51](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionSender.sol#L28-L51)<br>
[RedemptionReceiver.sol#L72-L105](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome/blob/7fda97c570b758bbfa7dd6724a336c43d4041740/contracts/contracts/redeem/RedemptionReceiver.sol#L72-L105)<br>

WeVE (FTM) may be lost forever if redemption process is failed.

Redemption process is likely to be failed if

*   (redeemedWEVE += amountWEVE) > eligibleWEVE
*   Not enough USDC or VELO in the contract

The case that redeem more than eligible can't be fixed because eligibleWEVE is hardcoded on contract initialization.

This mean that if there are any mistake for example LayerZero slow down and user try to repeatedly redeem their WeVE, user will lose their WeVE token forever due to contract always reverted in the destination chain due to the reason that user has redeemed more than eligible.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User redeem WeVE in fantom chain using redeemWEVE function in RedemptionSender contract.
2.  LayerZero slow but user think it is failed. (But it is just slow)
3.  User repeat process 1 again
4.  LayerZero call lzReceive in RedemptionReceiver contract on Optimism chain for the first time it's success. USDC + VELO is redeemed as intended.
5.  LayerZero call lzReceive in RedemptionReceiver contract on Optimism chain again due to repeated transaction in step 3. But this time, user has exceeded her redeem limit. Caused lzReceive call to revert with reason "cannot redeem more than eligible". **But doesn't refund WeVE to the user**

<!---->

            require(
                (redeemedWEVE += amountWEVE) <= eligibleWEVE,
                "cannot redeem more than eligible"
            );

6.  User FUD Velodrome and file a lawsuit against Velodrome.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   In RedemptionReceiver, Wrap lzReceive into another function and perform try catch on new lzReceive function to call old wrapped lzReceive function and on revert add refund amount to that user.
*   Write refund lzReceive handler on RedemptionSender.
*   Create a new refund function in RedemptionReceiver. When user call, it will send layerzero message back to lzReceive function in RedemptionSender contract on Fantom.

## [L-01] `Math.max(<x>,0)` used with `int` cast to `uint`

The code casts an `int` to a `uint` before passing it to `Math.max()`. It seems as though the `Math.max()` call is attempting to prevent values from being negative, but since the `int` is being cast to `uint`, the value will never be negative, and instead will overflow if either the multiplication involving the slope and timestamp is positive. I wasn't able to find a scenario where this is the case, but this seems very dangerous, and the `Math.max()` call is sending misleading signals, so I suggest moving it to inside the cast to `uint`

## [L-02] Front-runable initializer

There is nothing preventing another account from calling the initializer before the contract owner. In the best case, the owner is forced to waste gas and re-deploy. In the worst case, the owner does not notice that his/her call reverts, and everyone starts using a contract under the control of an attacker

## [L-03] `require()` should be used instead of `assert()`

Prior to solidity version 0.8.0, hitting an assert consumes the **remainder of the transaction's available gas** rather than returning it, as `require()`/`revert()` do. `assert()` should be avoided even past solidity version 0.8.0 as its [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require) states that "The assert function creates an error of type Panic(uint256). ... Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix".

## [N-01] `approveMax` variable causes problems

The `approveMax` variable controls whether the liquidity value is used, or the maximum is used.

In the worst case it leads to incorrect state handling

## [N-04] Use two-phase ownership transfers

## [G-01] Multiple `address` mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address` to a `struct`, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **\~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

*There are 8 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further gas optimizations with multiple instances, see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-velodrome-findings/issues/81).)*

## [G-02] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`

Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (**100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**).

*There are 5 instances of this issue.*

## [G-03] State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots

If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (**20000 gas**). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper

## [G-04] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution.

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

*There are 13 instances of this issue.*

## [G-05] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

*There are 39 instances of this issue.*

## [G-06] Multiple accesses of a mapping should use a local variable cache

The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **\~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

*There are 34 instances of this issue.*

## [G-07] `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables

*There are 21 instances of this issue.*

## [G-08] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas

Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

*There are 25 instances of this issue.*

## [G-09] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop

The overheads outlined below are *PER LOOP*, excluding the first loop

*   storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
*   memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
*   calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

*There are 17 instances of this issue.*

## [G-10] `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops

The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas [per loop](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)**

*There are 41 instances of this issue.*

## [G-11] `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

*There are 14 instances of this issue.*

## [G-12] `keccak256()` should only need to be called on a specific string literal once

It should be saved to an immutable variable, and the variable used instead. If the hash is being used as a part of a function selector, the cast to `bytes4` should also only be done once

## [G-13] Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead

```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**), and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past

## [G-14] Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement

This change saves **[6 gas](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/zeppelin/original/2X/3/363a367d6d68851f27d2679d10706cd16d788b96.png)** per instance

*There are 37 instances of this issue.*

## [G-17] Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas

See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper

*There are 17 instances of this issue.*

## [G-18] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

## [G-20] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the value can be read from the verified contract source code. Savings are due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

*There are 18 instances of this issue.*

## [G-21] Duplicated `require()`/`revert()` checks should be refactored to a modifier or function

Saves deployment costs

*There are 30 instances of this issue.*

## [G-22] Division by two should use bit shifting

`<x> / 2` is the same as `<x> >> 1`. The `DIV` opcode costs **5 gas**, whereas `SHR` only costs **3 gas**

*There are 9 instances of this issue.*

## [G-23] Stack variable used as a cheaper cache for a state variable is only used once

If the variable is only accessed once, it's cheaper to use the state variable directly that one time

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol   #1

1047:         uint _epoch = epoch;
```

## [G-24] `require()` or `revert()` statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables

*There are 13 instances of this issue.*

## [G-25] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save deployment gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. The instances below match or exceed that version

*There are 86 instances of this issue.*

 > The warden could have sent the 5 immutable variables findings and could have probably won.
> 
> Just the 5 immutable variables would save 2100 * 5 = 10500 gas for end users by saving at least on SLOAD.
> 
> Will rate the rest of the savings after reviewing other reports.

> Very thorough report, that I think missed 1 immutable variable. Overall great, however some findings would benefit by not pasting the same "mistake" 30+ times.
