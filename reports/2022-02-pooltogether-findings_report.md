# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the PoolTogether TWAB Delegator smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 22â€”February 24 2022.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded 1 unique MEDIUM severity vulnerability. Additionally, the analysis included 9 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical as well as 17 reports recommending gas optimizations. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Notably, 0 vulnerabilities were found during this audit contest that received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 PoolTogether TWAB Delegator contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-pooltogether), and is composed of 4 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 420 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

### Vulnerability details

When the `_from` address is not the `msg.sender` `_multiCall()` will be made on behalf of the `msg.sender`. As a result each of the functions called by `multiCall()` will be made on behalf of `msg.sender` and not `_from`.

If functions such as `transfer()` or `unstake()` are called `msg.sender` will be the original caller which would transfer the attacker the funds if the `to` field is set to an attackers address.

Furthermore, if an attacker we to call `permitAndMulticall()` before the `_from` user they may use their signature and nonce combination. As a nonce is only allowe to be used once the siganture will no longer be valid and `_permitToken.permit()` will fail on the second call.

An attacker may use this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by continually front-running `permitAndCall()` using other users signatures.

### Proof of Concept
```solidity
function _multicall(bytes[] calldata _data) internal virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
  results = new bytes[](_data.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _data.length; i++) {
    results[i] = Address.functionDelegateCall(address(this), _data[i]);
  }
  return results;
}
```
```solidity
function _permitAndMulticall(
  IERC20Permit _permitToken,
  address _from,
  uint256 _amount,
  Signature calldata _permitSignature,
  bytes[] calldata _data
) internal {
  _permitToken.permit(
    _from,
    address(this),
    _amount,
    _permitSignature.deadline,
    _permitSignature.v,
    _permitSignature.r,
    _permitSignature.s
  );

  _multicall(_data);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider updating the `_from` field to be the `msg.sender` in `permitAndMulticall()` (or alternatively do this in `_permitAndMulticall()` to save some gas).
```solidity
function permitAndMulticall(
  uint256 _amount,
  Signature calldata _permitSignature,
  bytes[] calldata _data
) external {
  _permitAndMulticall(IERC20Permit(address(ticket)), msg.sender, _amount, _permitSignature, _data);
}
```

By front-running a call `permitAndMulticall()` with the same `_from` account, an attacker is able to use up the user's nonce and DoS their transactions.

### Line References

[Delegation.sol#L39-L46](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/21bb53b2ea54a248bbd1d3170dbadd3a0c83d874/contracts/Delegation.sol#L39-L46)

### Vulnerability details

`Delegation` is a contract deployed dedicated to holding the `ticket` tokens for the `delegator` and they can then be `delegate` to a `delegatee`.

On the `Delegation` contract, there is a method named `executeCalls()` designed for "Executes calls on behalf of this contract" which allows arbitrary code execution for the owner.

However, we found that the owner of `Delegation` will always be `TWABDelegator`, and the `TWABDelegator` will only use `Delegation.sol#executeCalls()` to call one particular address: the `ticket` address, and for only two methods: `transfer()` and `delegate()`.

Furthermore, even though in `Delegation.sol#executeCalls()`, `calls[i].value` is used, the function is not being marked as `payable`, that makes it hard for calls that requires eth payments.

[Delegation.sol#L39-L46](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/21bb53b2ea54a248bbd1d3170dbadd3a0c83d874/contracts/Delegation.sol#L39-L46)

```solidity
function executeCalls(Call[] calldata calls) external onlyOwner returns (bytes[] memory) {
  bytes[] memory response = new bytes[](calls.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
    response[i] = _executeCall(calls[i].to, calls[i].value, calls[i].data);
  }
  return response;
}
```

While the `ticket` is being delegated through `TWABDelegator`, they won't be able to retrieve the tickets back until the `lockUntil`, without the ability to make arbitrary code execution, the `delegator` may miss some of the potential benefits as a holder of the `ticket` tokens, for example, an airdrop to all holders of the `ticket` tokens, or an NFT made mintable only for certain ticket holders.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a new method on `TWABDelegator`:

```solidity
function executeCalls(
  address _delegator,
  uint256 _slot,
  Delegation.Call[] memory calls
) external payable returns (bytes[] memory) {
  _requireDelegatorOrRepresentative(_delegator);
  Delegation _delegation = Delegation(_computeAddress(_delegator, _slot));

  if (block.timestamp < _delegation.lockUntil()) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
      if (calls[i].to == address(ticket)) {
        revert("TWABDelegator/delegation-locked");
      }
    }
  }

  return _delegation.executeCalls{value: msg.value}(_calls);
}
```

And also, consider making `Delegation.sol#executeCalls()` a `payable` method.

**[0xleastwood (judge) decreased severity to Low and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-pooltogether-findings/issues/27#issuecomment-1062705166):**
 > I don't really see a case where `_delegateCall()` or `_transferCall()` will need to have some ETH attached with it. They are solely dealing with the Ticket ERC20 token and updating delegation data. Considering the fact that rewards are handled by a separate contract, I think its fair to downgrade this to `1 (Low Risk)`.

## [[N-01] Tickets can get locked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-pooltogether-findings/issues/10)
_Submitted by CertoraInc_

if a user calls `transferDelegationTo` with the address of the `TWABDelegator` contract as the `to` parameter, the tokens will be transferred to the address without minting the user the stake token, so maybe you can think of adding this functionality. I know that there is the `withdrawDelegationToStake` function for that, but that can be nice to enable it that way too.

**[PierrickGT (PoolTogether) confirmed, but disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-pooltogether-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-1057131932):**
> The tickets would actually get stuck in the contract. I've added a require to avoid transferring directly to the contract.

> Based on the severity criteria, I think this one should be labelled as a 2 (Med Risk) issue. Would be an error from the user interacting with the functions but funds would indeed be at risk, not direct but at risk.

The comments say that the withdrawn tickets are transferred to the caller / delegator wallet, but are actually transferred to the `_to` address.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
```

### Line References
[TWABDelegator.sol#L102](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L102)

### Description
The `DelegationFundedFromStake()` allows a representative or delegator himself to fund a delegation contract using the delegatorâ€™s stake. The `user` in the `DelegationFundedFromStake` event refers to `msg.sender`. Since the funds are coming solely from the delegator, its description isnâ€™t entirely correct.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
`@param user Address of the user who pulled funds from the delegator to the delegation`

## [G-01] Loop in `Delegation` and `PermitAndMulticall` contracts

Loops can be optimized in several ways. Let's take for example the loop in the `executeCalls` function of the `Delegation` contract.

```solidity
function executeCalls(Call[] calldata calls) external onlyOwner returns (bytes[] memory) {
  bytes[] memory response = new bytes[](calls.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
    response[i] = _executeCall(calls[i].to, calls[i].value, calls[i].data);
  }
  return response;
}
```

To optimize this loop and make it consume less gas, we can do the foloowing things:

1.  Use ++i instead of i++, which is a cheaper operation (in this case there is no difference between i++ and ++i because we dont use the return value of this expression, which is the only difference between these two expression).
2.  Save the `calls` array length in a local variable instead of accessing it in every iteration.
3.  Save `calls[i]` in a local variable instead of accessing it 3 times in every iteration. This will save accssing the array's ith element 3 times in every iteration ,which requires an address calculation.
4.  There's no need to initialize i to its default value, it will be done automatically and it will consume more gas if it will be done (I know, sounds stupid, but trust me - it works).

So after applying all these changes, the loop will look something like this:

```solidity
function executeCalls(Call[] calldata calls) external onlyOwner returns (bytes[] memory) {
  bytes[] memory response = new bytes[](calls.length);
  uint256 length = calls.length;
  Call memory call;
  for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
    call = calls[i];
    response[i] = _executeCall(call.to, call.value, call.data);
  }
  return response;
}
```

## [G-02] Inline all these little functions

Defining all these little functions cause 2 things:

1.  contract's code size gets bigger
2.  the function calls consumes more gas than exectuing it as an inlined function (part of the code, without the function call)

So in order to save gas, I would recommend to inline these functions.

```solidity
function _computeAddress(address _delegator, uint256 _slot) internal view returns (address) {
  return _computeAddress(_computeSalt(_delegator, bytes32(_slot)));
}

function _computeLockUntil(uint96 _lockDuration) internal view returns (uint96) {
  return uint96(block.timestamp) + _lockDuration;
}

function _requireDelegatorOrRepresentative(address _delegator) internal view {
  require(
    _delegator == msg.sender || representatives[_delegator][msg.sender] == true,
    "TWABDelegator/not-delegator-or-rep"
  );
}

function _requireDelegateeNotZeroAddress(address _delegatee) internal pure {
  require(_delegatee != address(0), "TWABDelegator/dlgt-not-zero-adr");
}

function _requireAmountGtZero(uint256 _amount) internal pure {
  require(_amount > 0, "TWABDelegator/amount-gt-zero");
}

function _requireDelegatorNotZeroAddress(address _delegator) internal pure {
  require(_delegator != address(0), "TWABDelegator/dlgtr-not-zero-adr");
}

function _requireRecipientNotZeroAddress(address _to) internal pure {
  require(_to != address(0), "TWABDelegator/to-not-zero-addr");
}

function _requireDelegationUnlocked(Delegation _delegation) internal view {
  require(block.timestamp >= _delegation.lockUntil(), "TWABDelegator/delegation-locked");
}

function _requireContract(address _address) internal view {
  require(_address.isContract(), "TWABDelegator/not-a-contract");
}

function _requireLockDuration(uint256 _lockDuration) internal pure {
  require(_lockDuration <= MAX_LOCK, "TWABDelegator/lock-too-long");
}
```

> We've implemented the different fixes regarding the for loops, except for the `++i` recommendation, we kept `i++` for better code clarity.
> About the inline suggestion, we prefer to keep the code in reusable functions to keep a more readable and easier to update codebase than if we had to repeat our code through inlining.
